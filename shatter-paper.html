        <h2>II. <em>Shatter</em></h2>

        <blockquote>The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls.<br />
            <strong>Pablo Picasso</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <section id="shatter-chapter-2-section-1">
            <p>Nowadays, computers are prolific. Pretty much everyone has one in their pockets in the shape of a
                smartphone. Some people even wear computers. Digital technology is everywhere. </p>
            <p>If we turn the dial back to 1984, we see that computers were still thought of as a science-fiction
                device. While kids loved their video games, adults regarded computers with awe. At the time, few
                understood what they were capable of then or how transformative they would be in all areas of life going
                forward. Only two years prior, William Gibson had coined the term "cyberspace." The writer had published
                his debut novel Neuromancer, a book that led a wave of excitement about the possibilities of computers.
                In 1984 Apple founder Steve Jobs introduced the first Macintosh computer.</p>

            <h3>Colliding at the Cross-Section of Art and Technology</h3>
            <p>It seemed that the Apple Macintosh was destined for graphics work, for art. At its launch, Apple made
                programs available such as MacPaint and MacDraw. This opened up a world of possibilities for artists and
                for computer-assisted art and design.</p>
            <p>Throughout the history of comics, writers and artists have experimented with the medium in a multitude of
                ways. They have developed artistic techniques to change existing conventions into something new. Through
                changes in the culture around them, they have seen new perspectives and depicted the cognitive shift in
                their work. In the early 1980s, comics grew stale and timid. The mainstream titles such as The Uncanny
                X-Men and The New Teen Titans had turned from the daring upstarts to the status quo. Not only audiences
                but also the artists producing comic books had a constant hunger for something fresh and exciting.</p>

            <p>Still from Bladerunner, directed by Ridley Scott in 1982.</p>

            <p>As William Gibson once said: "The street finds its own uses for things." The advent of the first
                affordable graphics computer, the zeitgeist of cyberpunk, and the hunger for new visuals and
                storytelling collided at the cross section of technology and art. In 1985 they converged to create
                <em>Shatter</em>, the first digitally produced comic book.

            <h3>What Is <em>Shatter</em> About?</h3>
            <p>First Comics Publishing's <em>Shatter</em> was created by artist Mike Saenz and writer Peter B. Gillis.
                It is a self-described tech-noir thriller, the story of the private eye Sadr al-Din Morales, commonly
                referred to as <em>Shatter</em>. The story is very much of its time. Much of it stands on the shoulders
                of works such as Ridley Scott's 1982 film Bladerunner and Gibson's novel Neuromancer. In its own campy
                way, <em>Shatter</em> discusses concepts that are nowadays common and perhaps even quaint, such as the
                dangers of technology in a dystopian future and the distrust of corporations. In its own way, the book
                eschews the main subject matter of mainstream comic books by aspiring to be cyberpunk without explicitly
                claiming to be it. Cyberpunk, we remember, is the grim and gritty science fiction sub-genre. This
                "combination of lowlife and high tech" (as described by Bruce Sterling in his preface to William
                Gibson's Burning Chrome) features advanced technology, such as global networks, brain-computer
                interfaces, and artificial intelligence, all coexisting and competing with the radical breakdown of
                social order, as only the early 1980s could imagine. </p>

            <p>Splash page from <em>Shatter</em> #2, (art by Mike Saenz).</p>

            <p>The protagonist, <em>Shatter</em>, takes on the job of tracking down a serial killer who killed the board
                members of a large corporation. When he finds her, she reveals to him that the corporation uses human
                RNA to transfer the skill sets of people to others. Our hero finds himself involved with the underground
                movement dedicated to stopping this practice. In a surprising turn of events, <em>Shatter</em> finds out
                that he has "golden brain" that keeps any RNA‑induced talents indefinitely without losing them, as
                everyone else does eventually.</p>
            <p><em>Shatter</em> occasionally veers toward the prophetic when it depicts our protagonist bidding on a
                "gig" to take a case, hinting at today's emerging "gig economy," as found on fiverr.com and upwork.com.
                Other concepts sound unrealistic but not completely out of the question, such as splicing talents into a
                person's RNA to give them the special abilities of a gifted artist, athlete, or businessman.</p>
            <p>But the story is not what makes <em>Shatter</em> special. It is the process of its creation.</p>

            <h3>Digital Storytelling</h3>
            <p>Finding a true "first" is never cut and dry, so calling <em>Shatter</em> the first digitally produced
                comic might not be completely true. If we dig deeply into the Bulletin Board System (BBS) culture of the
                late 70s to early 80s, the precursor to the web and the internet as we know it today, we will find users
                who had distributed digitally produced comics as ASCII art, semigraphics, or even as digitized captures
                of analog art. That being said, <em>Shatter</em> deserves one commendation for being "first": It
                definitely was the first commercially available digitally produced comic book.</p>

            <p>Apple Macintosh Plus(Image Source: shrineofapple.com)</p>

            <p>In 1985 <em>Shatter</em> showed that the potential for computer-assisted comic-book art was a reality.
                The art for publication was drawn by hand on the computer as opposed to later methods of scanning in
                inked pages for digital coloring. Publisher First Comics Publishing had a potential hit on their hands—a
                hit through the novelty of new technology.</p>
            <p>Artist Mike Saenz started with a series of rough pencil sketches for each page. These were reviewed by
                the editors of the comic. When approved, Saenz drew the comic pages on a Macintosh Plus with 1MB RAM
                using MacPaint and MacDraw. The pages were saved on a disk drive with floppies holding a paltry 800 KB.
                The greatest challenge was drawing on the nine-inch monochrome screen with a resolution of 512 × 342
                pixels. The screen was so small that the artist could only see and work on a section of the current page
                (by some accounts, two-thirds of the page). Saenz drew the pages using the standard Mac mouse; there
                were no scanners available to capture analog art, and the artists of <em>Shatter</em> only procured
                digitizer tablets at a later time.</p>
            <p>For the first issues, the artist printed the pages on an Apple dot-matrix ImageWriter. In late 1985, when
                the regular series launched, Apple donated a LaserWriter.</p>
            <p>Quoting series editor Mike Gold in the editorial of <em>Shatter</em> #1:</p>
            <blockquote>Better still, Apple came out with their LaserWriter, an unbelievable printer that produces
                crisp, sharp printouts of Mike's work. For graphics art reproduction, the difference between the
                LaserWriter and traditional dot-matrix printers is like the difference between glossy coffee-table art
                books and paintings on cave walls. And better still, the folks up at Apple gave us a LaserWriter. That
                sucker isn't exactly cheap; it's nice to know you're appreciated. Thanks, Apple!</blockquote>
            <p>The LaserWriter enabled Adobe PostScript font styles for typesetting text and made illustration graphics
                smoother and less pixelated because of the device's powerful interpolation.</p>

            <h3>First Comics Publishing and the History of <em>Shatter</em></h3>
            <p>The three people most closely identified with <em>Shatter</em> are artist Mike Saenz, writer Peter B.
                Gillis (both of whom created the series), and artist Charlie Athanas, who joined the publication in
                issue #8.</p>
            <p>Chicago-born artist Mike Saenz started work on <em>Shatter</em> at the age of 26. The book was among his
                first professional work and served as his breakthrough. After working on <em>Shatter</em>, Saenz went on
                to produce digital comics for Marvel and to work in software development.</p>
            <p>Mike Saenz in 1985 (source: <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Mike_Saenz"
                    target="_blank">http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki"">http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Mike_Saenz</a>)</p>
            <p>Peter B. Gillis was an established comics writer when he started work on <em>Shatter</em> at the age of
                32. He had freelanced for Marvel Comics with his first published story in Captain America. After
                numerous credits in Marvel's second-tier comic books, Gillis went on to work as an editor for the
                Florida-based publisher New Media Publishing until 1981. His first work for First Comics Publishing was
                the science-fiction series Warp until 1985. Then he joined the team of <em>Shatter</em>.</p>

            <p>Peter B. Gillis in the 2010s (source: <a href="http://comicbookdb.com/creator.php?ID=960"
                    target="_blank">http://comicbookdb.com/creator.php?ID=960</a>)</p>

            <p>In the early 1980s, publisher First Comics Publishing was one of the few alternatives to the "big two":
                Marvel Comics (Spider-Man, X-Men, Avengers) and DC Comics (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman).</p>
            <p><em>Shatter</em> saw its first printing in the British computer games magazine Big K, issue #12, its last
                issue before it ceased publication. It was a four-page story printed in black and white. The series was
                touted as "the first computerized comic." According to one report, Saenz and Gillis had offered the
                series to Marvel Comics, who declined; only then was it picked up by First Comics Publishing.</p>
            <p>After its debut, <em>Shatter</em> went on to be published by First Comics Publishing (Chicago) as a
                back-up feature to the ongoing comic series Jon Sable. These eight-page installments ran from issues #25
                to #30 of the Jon Sable series. The feature proved to be so popular that publisher First Comics decided
                to release a <em>Shatter</em> special issue with 28 original story pages by Mike Saenz and Peter B.
                Gillis.</p>

            <p>It sold 100,000 copies in three days, breaking the existing sales records for independent comic books. In
                1985 a high-selling issue of Marvel Comics's The Uncanny X-Men sold 300,000 copies. By comparison, sales
                of <em>Shatter</em> were very impressive for an independent comics publisher.</p>
            <p>First Comics commissioned an ongoing series. At this point, writer Peter B. Gillis had moved on, so the
                artist Mike Saenz started to not only draw the book but also provide the plot and script.</p>
            <p>The first issue of the ongoing <em>Shatter</em> series sold 60,000 copies. After releasing issue #2, Mike
                Saenz left his creation to work on other projects. In 1988 he would go on to produce the full-color
                digital graphic novel Iron Man: Crash for Marvel Comics and work on the comic creation app ComicWorks
                before being bought out by software maker Macromedia.</p>

            <h3>Audience Reactions</h3>
            <p>This paper was written in 2018. Now, more than 30 years later, it is difficult to assess what the
                original audience reaction was at the time of publication. The few remaining reviews show very positive
                feedback lauding the use of the Macintosh. In hindsight, much of the praise is directed towards the
                promised potential of digital art and not always the results on display at the time.</p>
            <p>In the series' letters pages, readers criticized the story for being a derivative of Blade Runner. In
                issue #2, one reader writes: "The only thing bad about it is the story. It does not make much sense and
                the whole thing is terrible." </p>
            <p>While the digital art did find a lot of praise ("The graphics inside are excellent" from the letters
                column in issue #2), it was not universally praised, as can be seen in this letter from the same issue:
                "The graphics in <em>Shatter</em> are likely to be more of a turn off to potential computer comic
                connoisseurs due to their primitive quality and unimaginative execution."</p>
            <p>The oddest reactions still available in their original form are from the letters pages of the series.
                First Comics Publishing advertised the digital nature of the series and went to great lengths to explain
                the process in its editorial pages. Nevertheless, in issue #3, a reader writes that they doubt that the
                art was, in fact, produced on a computer:</p>
            <blockquote>I'm not accusing you of doing anything yet, but a lot of <em>Shatter</em> #1 looked like it
                wasn't quite done by computer ... The curves in the walls are just too perfect, even for a computer ...
                I figure if you're going to do a comic on a computer, you ought to make it look like a computer
                drawing, not like a drawing done by hand.</blockquote>
            <p>The editor responded that for a small fee they would be happy to send a disk to the reader with the
                original artwork in its digital form as proof.</p>

            <p>Readers' baffling reactions in the letters page.</p>

            <p>After moving on to DC Comics, Mike Gold, the original editor of <em>Shatter</em>, reminisced about the
                series in the introduction of DC's own digital comic effort Batman: Digital Justice in 1990 (emphasis
                provided by the writer of this paper):</p>
            <blockquote>At that time, I was the editor of a midwest comic book company when a couple of old friends,
                Peter Gillis and Mike Saenz, showed me rough printouts of a story that was produced on a 128 K Apple
                Macintosh computer, using but one disk drive. The artwork was chunky and brittle: it looked like some
                amphetamine addict had been given a box of a zip-a-tone that suffered from a glandular disease. But the
                look was totally unique to comics. Within several months, we refined the look and the resulting effort
                '<em>Shatter</em>' was one of the best-selling comics of the year. It completely astonished the folks
                over at Apple Computer, Inc., who never perceived such a use for their hardware.</blockquote>
        </section>

        <section id="shatter-chapter-2-section-6">
            <h3>Tumultuous Changes</h3>
            <p>Ultimately, <em>Shatter</em> would run for 14 issues from 1985 to 1988, but in 1986, after Mike Saenz
                left, First Comics Publishing did not want its successful series to suffer delay. Not to leave the
                series without a writer and an artist, Steven Grant jumped in to fill the writer's role for issues #3
                and #4 while Steve Erwin and Bob Dienenthal took over the art chores for issues #3 to #7.</p>

            <p>Internal story page from <em>Shatter</em> #2 (art by Mike Saenz).</p>
            <p>The art in these issues was workable but no longer special because the artists penciled and inked
                traditionally and had their pages scanned into the Macintosh to be lettered in MacPaint. This deprived
                <em>Shatter</em> of its special look. The art degraded to standard comic book art, albeit strongly
                pixelated to suggest that computers remained a vital part of the production process.
            </p>
            <p>At least in issue #5, original writer Peter B. Gillis returned to the fold to give the story focus and
                the dialog edge. But <em>Shatter</em> would still need another couple of issues before it could hit its
                stride with a new artist coming on board.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="shatter-chapter-2-section-7">
            <h3>Charlie Athanas to the Rescue</h3>
            <p>The departure of Mike Saenz left <em>Shatter</em> without its main selling point: art drawn directly on a
                computer. The book needed to return to its unique art style. It needed a new artist who was capable of
                producing the artwork on a Macintosh. Enter Charlie Athanas. This young artist from Illinois joined the
                team just in time to continue the storyline Peter B. Gillis started.</p>
            <p>On his website, Athanas describes the process:</p>
            <blockquote>Artwork created from layout to the black and white 'camera ready' art before color was added in
                the traditional method. I produced this art on a MacPlus with 1 MB of RAM and an 800 K floppy drive.
                Only about two-thirds of a full page was visible to work on unless you switched to thumbnail mode to see
                the entire page on a drastically reduced scale. About half the issues were drawn with the standard Mac
                mouse until a small drawing tablet became commercially available.</blockquote>

            <p>Athanas re-established drawing directly on the Macintosh Plus with the computer mouse. To speed up
                publication efficiency, Athanas drafted rough pencil sketches in order to sketch out layout design,
                speed up the writing of the script, and go through editorial review.</p>

            <p>Without scanners at his disposal, Athanas manually redrew the rough sketches directly on this Mac. Now
                that the series was back to computer-drawn artwork, the pages had a much cleaner art style. Athanas not
                only used MacPaint but also FullPaint by Ann Arbor Softworks.</p>

            <p><em>Shatter</em> was saved for the time being. Sales stabilized with the new creative team. But alas,
                technology progressed at a breakneck pace in the mid to late 80s. The home-computer revolution had
                started to sweep computers into every American household. A comic series about a dystopian future no
                longer captured its readers' imaginations. With issue #12, Peter B. Gillis left as a writer to be
                succeeded by Jay Case. First Comics Publishing met with financial difficulties, and the series' novelty
                of new technology wore off. Sales started to slip, and by 1988 they had dropped sufficiently to make the
                publication no longer viable. First Comics Publishing allowed the creators to complete their story but
                no longer start a new one. <em>Shatter</em> was cancelled with issue #14.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the first sustained experiment in commercial digital-art production after three tumultuous
                years. By then, editor Mike Gold had left for DC Comics, leaving editor Rick Oliver to write the last
                words for the series in the letters page of <em>Shatter</em> #14 (cover date April 1988):</p>

            <blockquote>When <em>Shatter</em> first appeared, it was produced solely with the software that came
                packaged with the Macintosh; Apple's own MacPaint. More recently, we have also incorporated MacDraw,
                Word, Switcher, MacBillboard, and FullPaint. This letters column and the First Notes page were produced
                with Word and XPress, an electronic page make-up program. </blockquote>

            <p>There are more new graphics programs available every day, each more sophisticated than the last, and
                there's no telling where it will all lead.</p>
            <p>But for now, <em>Shatter</em> has served its purpose, and it's time to move on. Thanks to all our loyal
                readers who stuck it out through both the great and the not-so-great issues. Thanks to Peter Gillis and
                Mike Saenz for starting the ball rolling, Steve Erwin and Bob Dienethal for keeping it going and
                finally, let's give a big hand for Charlie Athanas for revitalizing the book for a classy finish.</p>
            <p>The technology might not yet have been advanced enough, but <em>Shatter</em> proved one thing to the
                comic book industry: comics could be produced digitally, and dots by any other name could still be art.

            <p>For the purposes of this paper, it is of great interest to compare the process used to create
                <em>Shatter</em> with the process used most commonly in American comics of the 1980s and then juxtapose
                that
                with the process used nowadays (2018). This will show how much <em>Shatter</em> deviated from its
                contemporaries and allow us to investigate how much of its production process can be found in today's
                comic
                books.
            </p>

            <h3>The Typical Process in the 1980s</h3>
            <p>The writer of the comic typed the story and the script on his typewriter and sent it to the editor for
                review.</p>
            <p>Once approved, this physical script went to the penciller, who sketched the rough layout scribbles of the
                22
                individual pages. These were much smaller than the original artwork or the printed page and served for
                design purposes. Then the penciller drew the actual pages (usually at double the size of the printed
                page)
                with the figures, the props, and the background scenery or locations.</p>
            <p>In some cases, the penciled pages were returned to the writer who then provided the script for the
                captions,
                dialog, and thought balloons. In other cases, the script already had all the captions and dialog when
                the
                penciller received it.</p>
            <p>In the next stage, the letterer drew the caption boxes, speech bubbles, and thought balloons to then
                place
                the letters in them.</p>
            <p>As soon as the penciled and lettered pages were completed, they were sent to the inker. They redrew the
                penciller's art by tracing the lines—providing them with weight, cleaning them up, and giving the solids
                some texture. The inker made sure that objects in the distance were drawn with a faint line and closer
                objects or characters were drawn with the full weight they needed to tell the story. </p>
            <p>Finally, the colorist applied colors and tones to the artwork by hand.</p>
            <p>The pages of the comic book are then photographed for print and reduced to the desired size.</p>

            <h3>The Process used for <em>Shatter</em></h3>
            <p>The digital workflow of <em>Shatter</em> also starts with the script. But as described by Mike Gold, the
                series' editor, in the editorial of <em>Shatter</em> Special #1, "... Peter would dialogue Mike's art on
                an Apple III, but it would be lettered on the Mac."</p>
            <p>In <em>Shatter</em> #3, Editor Mike Gold continued to describe the process: "Virtually everything in
                <em>Shatter</em>, prior to the coloring phase, is generated as Apple Macintosh MacPaint computer files
                and
                then printed on an Apple Laserwriter."
            </p>
            <p>And further in the editorial of <em>Shatter</em> Special #1:</p>
            <p>Together with First Comics' production manager Alex Said and editorial coordinator Rick Oliver, we agreed
                that every aspect of <em>Shatter</em> would be performed on the Mac - the art, the lettering, the logo,
                the
                advertising, even this editorial. Everything but the color. We could create the color on the Mac (and we
                could come up with some interesting effects by creating a wider range of tones) but it would take far
                too
                much time.</p>

            <p>So, the process used for <em>Shatter</em> saved on transcribing the script and on producing the pencils
                to be
                inked because the artwork was drafted directly on the computer. The coloring as the last step still
                maintained the established traditional workflow and did not save any time in this respect.</p>

            <h3>The Typical Process in 2018</h3>
            <p>Today, we need to distinguish between comic books produced by the "big two" commercial comic book
                publishers,
                Marvel and DC Comics (and to a lesser extent, the next large publishers Image and Dark Horse), and those
                comics produced by independent artists or groups of artists.</p>

            <h4>Commercial Comics</h4>
            <p>Even at the time of writing this paper, the steps in creating a physically printed commercial comic book
                have
                not changed drastically compared to 1985, but the process is greatly expedited. A writer writes the plot
                and
                the script and sends it as an email to the editor who then provides all the changes and forwards it to
                the
                artist.</p>
            <p>This where the process becomes very disparate. Different artists work differently. Some will still draw
                the
                artwork on paper board using a pencil and then either ink it themselves or pass it on to an inker to be
                embellished. Even if this analog path is chosen, some artists will still use digital references or even
                trace from printouts of digital sources. They might model difficult background shots using 3D software
                and
                then draw from this reference. In any case, the artwork is scanned into the computer and sent as a
                digital
                file to the publisher for further processing.</p>
            <p>Two steps in the process have switched nearly exclusively to digital: lettering and sound effects and the
                coloring of the book.</p>

            <p>An artist using a Wacom Cintiq 24"(Source:
                <a href="http://www.antcgi.com/2014/05/27/thoughts-on-the-wacom-cintiq-24hd/"
                    target="_blank">http://www.antcgi.com/2014/05/27/thoughts-on-the-wacom-cintiq-24hd/</a>)
            </p>

            <p>While a large part of the drawings for commercial comic books is still produced using analog means, the
                tendency to produce purely digitally is slowly prevailing in independent comics. Artists either draft
                their
                artwork directly on a screen using a Wacom tablet, Microsoft Surface, or iPad Pro or they sketch on
                paper
                and refine their work digitally. Some artists use 3D software to meticulously render their characters,
                props, and backgrounds. Then they combine the components using paint or layout software.</p>
            <p>That being said, commercial superstar artists like DC Vice President and Superman artist Jim Lee and
                Green
                Lantern artist Ethan Van Sciver still pencil and ink their work.</p>
            <p>Even though exceptions do exist, to this day, the mainstream process is still not fully digital with
                analog
                steps remaining for drafting and inking. The process of coloring and lettering are fully digital. One of
                the
                reasons for the pedantically segmented process in commercial comics is strict editorial control over
                every
                step. This not only allows the editor to play gatekeeper, catching any potential quality issues or any
                part
                of the commissioned work that might be inadequate or inappropriate, it also allows the editor to keep an
                eye
                on the progress of the comic book from the first word laid down to the finished piece being delivered to
                the
                printer.</p>
            <p>Strangely, this only partially digital production process needs to end in a digital file for printers to
                handle. Even though the sales of physical comic books are dwindling in 2018, digital distribution of
                comic
                books through vendors like comixology.com cannot yet compensate for the drop in sales.</p>

            <h4>Independent Artists</h4>
            <p>Again, it is hard to generalize; there will always be artists who prefer traditional analog means. In
                some
                cases, they might not even use pencil and ink on paper but could use a completely different analog
                media,
                such as oil on canvas or collage or any of the multitude of different techniques established over the
                centuries.</p>
            <p>Independent comics artists often work alone or, at most, in a small team. They mostly do not have a
                support
                infrastructure, so they do more on their own. This is one of the reasons why digital production is more
                common in the field of independent artists.</p>
            <p>Due to the lack of editorial control, the process does not even always need to start with a ready plot
                and
                script but can start with sketches that evolve into a complete story. But for the sake of comparability,
                let
                us start the digital process an independent artist uses with the story creation (plot and potentially
                script). They then might produce thumbnail layouts of the pages to get an idea of the story flow and the
                necessary number of panels. This might be done on paper or, already at this stage, on the computer.</p>
            <p>Then the digital artist completes the final stages with digital tools. Outline art might be drawn
                similarly
                to previous techniques with a sketch, a finer rendering of the sketch in more detail, and then the final
                cleanup. But because they are working digitally, they are not bound to the processes of physical media.
            </p>
            <p>After rendering the outlines, the color art can be produced without delay or the need to change medium in
                the
                next step. Lettering and sound effects are added. And the page is done.</p>
            <p>Purely digital pieces can be distributed over the web; those produced for print can be emailed to the
                printers for direct printing.</p>

            <p>The Smith Micro application Poser allows artists to pose 3D charactersand render them out as ink drawings
                for
                use in their comics.</p>

            <h3>Comparing the Processes</h3>
            <p>By contrast, <em>Shatter</em> was limited by the available means of communication, with disks with the
                digital materials being mailed conventionally. But save for this, the whole process was digital. The
                limitations of the printing presses made it necessary to produce a hardcopy of the line art so that it
                could
                be photographed for the plate-based offset printing of the day. Coloring solely on a computer was not
                yet
                feasible on the machines available in 1985, remaining a task to be done by hand the traditional way.

            <p>While Mike Saenz was the first to produce and publish a complete comic book on a computer, other artists
                quickly followed. In 1988, German comic book artist Michael Götze created the Das Robot Imperium comic
                album. This was the first European comic created on a computer. He did not use an Apple Macintosh to
                create
                this black-and-white comic, but instead the Atari 520ST, an affordable competitor of the Mac that also
                came
                with a mouse by default.</p>

            <h3>Pixel Imperium</h3>
            <p>The comic's story chronicled the fight of a small group of humans against the robots who ruled over them.
                Even in the 1980s, this was not the most original plot. Like <em>Shatter</em>, this comic's main selling
                point was that the artist created it on a computer.</p>
            <p>Even though the first volume of Das Robot Imperium "Jäger ohne Gewissen" ('Hunter without a conscience")
                eschews the use of color, it is a far more lavish and elaborate work compared to <em>Shatter</em>. The
                scenes depicted in the panels have depth and dimensionality. The figures are not flat like in
                <em>Shatter</em>, Goetze renders the characters' faces with much greater expressiveness. He took much
                more
                time to produce each page than the fast release schedule of <em>Shatter</em> would allow.

            <h3>The Creation Process</h3>
            <p>On the Atari ST, Götze programmed his own 3D wireframe application and special printing software using
                GFA-Basic. In the application he called Pixelart, Götze created 3D models of the human body and put them
                in
                different poses. Then he combined the figures with flat backgrounds. He also modeled props and
                mechanical
                backgrounds like a command center in 3D. Once the 3D models were created, he could place them in the
                scene
                and create complicated perspectives with the wireframe models. Eventually, Goetze had a library of
                objects
                that he could reuse.</p>
            <p>He would laboriously touch up the images in the Atari ST paint application D.E.G.A.S. Elite using the
                mouse
                to give them the final polish.</p>
            <p>Work on Robot Imperium started in 1986 on the first of three volumes in the European album format. Götze
                drew
                the first volume in black-and-white. The gradients were dot patterns printed with a typical dot-matrix
                printer used in offices at the time: the Epson FX-80.</p>
            <p>The back of the first two volumes shows a photo of the artist Götze toiling away on his Atari ST. And the
                last few pages of the first volume describe Götze's process for drawing the panels on the Atari ST:
                "This Is
                How a Comic Is Made on a Computer" ("So entsteht ein Comic am Computer"). From today's perspective, it
                might
                appear comedic that the process description includes a short explanation of how a computer mouse works.
                There even is mention of <em>Shatter</em> by Mike Saenz and Peter B. Gillis (inexplicably, Gillis is
                referred to as Bernd Gillis in the text). The piece's writer does not show high regard for Saenz'
                computer
                art, calling it "unsatisfactory" and "experimental."</p>
            <p>The most interesting parts of this description were the screenshots of the individual steps in Götze's
                creation process. They show how he places the rudimentary 3D model of a spaceship over a rough sketch of
                the
                background foliage in a forest scene. The wireframes of the spaceship show all sides, even the parts
                that
                should be obscured from the viewer. Götze manually cleans up the image, meticulously removing the lines
                that
                should not be visible. Then he embellishes the manually-drawn backgrounds, thus integrating them with
                the 3D
                model. Then he spots the black areas and emphasizes individual lines to give them more weight. Finally,
                he
                shades the image in dotted patterns for different levels of light and dark.</p>
            <p>Artistically, this painstaking process proved to be very successful. The drawings are very much in the
                style
                of the French bandes desinée of the 1980s. This speaks to the artist's craftsmanship. Götze followed the
                first volume with the second one titled "Volthead" in 1990, this time in full color. It was printed on a
                dot-matrix printer in multiple passes with different colored ribbons. </p>

            <h3>The Ghost of A Different Future</h3>
            <p>In 1992, Götze released the third volume "Ein erster Sieg?" ("A First Victory?") with an even greater
                level
                of detail in his drawings and an even greater level of artistic accomplishment. Its slickness moved it
                so
                close to the traditionally drawn and colored analog comics to make it indistinguishable at first glance.
                This also meant that despite all the effort put into it, the comic lost one of its most distinguishing
                features. It lost the "look" of a computer comic.</p>
            <p>Commercially, Das Robot Imperium ended up not being very successful. It remains a testimony to artistic
                dedication, adventurous graphical experimentation, and the stubbornness to make the best use of the
                capabilities of a barely suitable computer to achieve professional results.</p>

            <h3>The Importance of <em>Shatter</em> as Media Art</h3>
            <p><em>Shatter</em> is very much of its time. The computer-generated art from the mid-80s is stiff and
                un-lifelike. At the same time, it shows a mad energy that comes from artists discovering what a piece of
                equipment can do beyond what anyone thought before them. This energy might be fueled by the intention to
                subvert the traditional comics production process.</p>
            <p>The art style is primitive by nowadays standards, but it is most definitely the star of the series
                compared
                to the run-of-the-mill story content. It is still visually interesting to look at each page and wonder
                at
                the intricacies that Mike Saenz and Charlie Athanas were able to eke out of their Macintosh.</p>
            <p>While only modestly entertaining as a piece of commercial entertainment, <em>Shatter</em> is a cultural
                artifact and a relic of a long-bygone era, with a good helping of quirkiness and originality in
                execution.
                It shows the evolutionary step taken to where technology has brought us today. To stay in evolutionary
                terms, this comic book is the fish whose fins more resemble legs, even though it has not yet fully left
                the
                sea. In essence, the idea of <em>Shatter</em> is fascinating. The idea that one day, comics might be
                produced digitally, but in 1985 Mike Saenz and Peter B. Gillis (and later Charlie Athanas) were
                impatient
                and did not want to wait for technology to catch up with their aspirations.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="shatter-chapter-5-section-2">
            <h3>Archiving <em>Shatter</em> for Media Arts Histories</h3>
            <p>Even though <em>Shatter</em> was produced digitally, it was always targeted at being printed. Its
                creators
                and the publishing company sought to print it and distribute it as a physical product. Preservation of
                individual printed copies is subject to the same principles as preserving other kinds of print media and
                periodicals: temperature- and moisture-regulated archives and a complete absence of light during
                storage.
            </p>
            <p>Aside from the physical medium, <em>Shatter</em> is one of the earliest artifacts with the raw content
                available as digital files. Unfortunately, the demise of First Comics Publishing has made it unlikely
                for us
                to use this venue to obtain the original digital files in the MacPaint format. It is certainly possible
                to
                seek out the files from the original artists. The physical media the files are stored on (disks or hard
                disks) might already be corrupted after three decades of storage. If the files can be found, then they
                can
                be archived in distributed storage systems such as a cloud or a raid setup. In one of the letters
                columns,
                the editor notes that for a small handling fee, the publishing company would be prepared to send a disk
                with
                digital artwork to interested parties. If any readers made use of this, then digital copies might be
                stored
                away on disks somewhere in the United States.</p>
            <p>Apart from the files generated during production, there might even be an animated digital trailer.
                According
                to one source, the original artist even put together something of the kind that was distributed on a
                disk.
                These might also still be available.</p>
            <p>It exceeds the mandate of this paper to locate them.</p>

            <h3>Learning from <em>Shatter</em></h3>
            <p>One might argue that it is not a matter of whether <em>Shatter</em> is a good piece of entertainment, an
                accomplished piece of art, or the culmination of a cultural discipline. Even at the time of its
                creation, it
                never pretended or aspired to be any of this. To many, <em>Shatter</em> exudes the strange fascination
                that
                Eadweard Muybridge's sequential photography of galloping horses and walking men and women in Victorian
                times
                manifests, even though we have contemporary 4K footage of the same motifs in much higher quality. </p>
            <p>It can even be argued that <em>Shatter</em> is not an artifact from the past that has had a great
                influence
                on how we create and even read comics today. Its reach was not great enough to have done so. But the
                technology it employed at the time certainly had taken its first steps towards the total digitization of
                the
                visual arts. Today we have become used to seeing computer-generated graphics in film, in commercial art,
                and
                in comics. The creators of <em>Shatter</em> were the first to see these possibilities in the available
                hardware before it was capable enough. </p>
            <p>When we run original Macintosh software in emulation, software such as MacPaint, MacDraw, and FullPaint,
                it
                is easy to lose sight of the context it was used in at the time. Perhaps, <em>Shatter</em> can open our
                eyes
                to this context. We shouldn't frown upon software's limitations but recognize how artists in the past
                used
                it for actual honest-to-God production work. They did not see the restrictions, rather they saw the
                potential for experimentation. And all of this with the pressure of publication deadlines looming.</p>
            <p>Exploring <em>Shatter</em> not only shows us the achievements of the creators but also their omissions,
                failings, and blind spots: They did not make any use of the nascent 3D graphics already taking shape on
                the
                16-Bit machines of the time. In the year of <em>Shatter</em>'s cancellation, comics artist Michael
                Goetze,
                from Germany, had already been making use of 3D graphics in his electronic comic Das Robot Imperium
                (Carlsen
                Comics, 1988) on the Atari ST, a 16-Bit computer of a similar generation as the Apple Macintosh.</p>
            <p>It is easy to take <em>Shatter</em> at face value and only see its clunkiness, its deficiencies, and the
                ineptitude in its execution. As an audience and perhaps even as fellow artists, we can all instead look
                at
                <em>Shatter</em> and ask ourselves how much time and effort Mike Saenz and Charlie Athanas have put into
                the
                work. At any point in their creative process, they had the opportunity to give up and abandon this
                tedious
                and thankless exercise. Perhaps, at some point, each one of them stepped back from the nine-inch screen,
                with its monochrome line art, and shook their heads, thinking how much effort they had put into this
                work
                that to some audiences might look bad or even, as Mike Gold put it, like "some amphetamine addict had
                been
                given a box of a zip-a-tone." Maybe they thought how much easier it might have been to take pencil and
                pen
                to paper instead.
            </p>
            <p>And perhaps they knew how "cool" they were, and perhaps they felt how subversive their art was because
                they
                were at the technological razor's edge in a world not yet ready for it.</p>

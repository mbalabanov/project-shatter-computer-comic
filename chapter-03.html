                        <p>For the purposes of this paper, it is of great interest to compare the process used to create
                            <em>Shatter</em> with the process used most commonly in American comics of the 1980s and
                            then juxtapose
                            that
                            with the process used nowadays (2018). This will show how much <em>Shatter</em> deviated
                            from its
                            contemporaries and allow us to investigate how much of its production process can be found
                            in today's
                            comic
                            books.

                        <h3>The Typical Process in the 1980s</h3>
                        <p>The writer of the comic typed the story and the script on his typewriter and sent it to the
                            editor for
                            review.</p>
                        <p>Once approved, this physical script went to the penciller, who sketched the rough layout
                            scribbles of the
                            22
                            individual pages. These were much smaller than the original artwork or the printed page and
                            served for
                            design purposes. Then the penciller drew the actual pages (usually at double the size of the
                            printed
                            page)
                            with the figures, the props, and the background scenery or locations.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, the penciled pages were returned to the writer who then provided the script
                            for the
                            captions,
                            dialog, and thought balloons. In other cases, the script already had all the captions and
                            dialog when
                            the
                            penciller received it.</p>
                        <p>In the next stage, the letterer drew the caption boxes, speech bubbles, and thought balloons
                            to then
                            place
                            the letters in them.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the penciled and lettered pages were completed, they were sent to the inker. They
                            redrew the
                            penciller's art by tracing the linesâ€”providing them with weight, cleaning them up, and
                            giving the solids
                            some texture. The inker made sure that objects in the distance were drawn with a faint line
                            and closer
                            objects or characters were drawn with the full weight they needed to tell the story. </p>
                        <p>Finally, the colorist applied colors and tones to the artwork by hand.</p>
                        <p>The pages of the comic book are then photographed for print and reduced to the desired size.

                        <h3>The Process used for <em>Shatter</em></h3>
                        <p>The digital workflow of <em>Shatter</em> also starts with the script. But as described by
                            Mike Gold, the
                            series' editor, in the editorial of <em>Shatter</em> Special #1, "... Peter would dialogue
                            Mike's art on
                            an Apple III, but it would be lettered on the Mac."</p>
                        <p>In <em>Shatter</em> #3, Editor Mike Gold continued to describe the process: "Virtually
                            everything in
                            <em>Shatter</em>, prior to the coloring phase, is generated as Apple Macintosh MacPaint
                            computer files
                            and
                            then printed on an Apple Laserwriter."
                        </p>
                        <p>And further in the editorial of <em>Shatter</em> Special #1:</p>
                        <p>Together with First Comics' production manager Alex Said and editorial coordinator Rick
                            Oliver, we agreed
                            that every aspect of <em>Shatter</em> would be performed on the Mac - the art, the
                            lettering, the logo,
                            the
                            advertising, even this editorial. Everything but the color. We could create the color on the
                            Mac (and we
                            could come up with some interesting effects by creating a wider range of tones) but it would
                            take far
                            too
                            much time.</p>

                            (right).</p>

                        <p>So, the process used for <em>Shatter</em> saved on transcribing the script and on producing
                            the pencils
                            to be
                            inked because the artwork was drafted directly on the computer. The coloring as the last
                            step still
                            maintained the established traditional workflow and did not save any time in this respect.

                        <h3>The Typical Process in 2018</h3>
                        <p>Today, we need to distinguish between comic books produced by the "big two" commercial comic
                            book
                            publishers,
                            Marvel and DC Comics (and to a lesser extent, the next large publishers Image and Dark
                            Horse), and those
                            comics produced by independent artists or groups of artists.</p>

                        <h4>Commercial Comics</h4>
                        <p>Even at the time of writing this paper, the steps in creating a physically printed commercial
                            comic book
                            have
                            not changed drastically compared to 1985, but the process is greatly expedited. A writer
                            writes the plot
                            and
                            the script and sends it as an email to the editor who then provides all the changes and
                            forwards it to
                            the
                            artist.</p>
                        <p>This where the process becomes very disparate. Different artists work differently. Some will
                            still draw
                            the
                            artwork on paper board using a pencil and then either ink it themselves or pass it on to an
                            inker to be
                            embellished. Even if this analog path is chosen, some artists will still use digital
                            references or even
                            trace from printouts of digital sources. They might model difficult background shots using
                            3D software
                            and
                            then draw from this reference. In any case, the artwork is scanned into the computer and
                            sent as a
                            digital
                            file to the publisher for further processing.</p>
                        <p>Two steps in the process have switched nearly exclusively to digital: lettering and sound
                            effects and the
                            coloring of the book.</p>

                        </p>

                        <p>While a large part of the drawings for commercial comic books is still produced using analog
                            means, the
                            tendency to produce purely digitally is slowly prevailing in independent comics. Artists
                            either draft
                            their
                            artwork directly on a screen using a Wacom tablet, Microsoft Surface, or iPad Pro or they
                            sketch on
                            paper
                            and refine their work digitally. Some artists use 3D software to meticulously render their
                            characters,
                            props, and backgrounds. Then they combine the components using paint or layout software.</p>
                        <p>That being said, commercial superstar artists like DC Vice President and Superman artist Jim
                            Lee and
                            Green
                            Lantern artist Ethan Van Sciver still pencil and ink their work.</p>
                        <p>Even though exceptions do exist, to this day, the mainstream process is still not fully
                            digital with
                            analog
                            steps remaining for drafting and inking. The process of coloring and lettering are fully
                            digital. One of
                            the
                            reasons for the pedantically segmented process in commercial comics is strict editorial
                            control over
                            every
                            step. This not only allows the editor to play gatekeeper, catching any potential quality
                            issues or any
                            part
                            of the commissioned work that might be inadequate or inappropriate, it also allows the
                            editor to keep an
                            eye
                            on the progress of the comic book from the first word laid down to the finished piece being
                            delivered to
                            the
                            printer.</p>
                        <p>Strangely, this only partially digital production process needs to end in a digital file for
                            printers to
                            handle. Even though the sales of physical comic books are dwindling in 2018, digital
                            distribution of
                            comic
                            books through vendors like comixology.com cannot yet compensate for the drop in sales.</p>

                        <h4>Independent Artists</h4>
                        <p>Again, it is hard to generalize; there will always be artists who prefer traditional analog
                            means. In
                            some
                            cases, they might not even use pencil and ink on paper but could use a completely different
                            analog
                            media,
                            such as oil on canvas or collage or any of the multitude of different techniques established
                            over the
                            centuries.</p>
                        <p>Independent comics artists often work alone or, at most, in a small team. They mostly do not
                            have a
                            support
                            infrastructure, so they do more on their own. This is one of the reasons why digital
                            production is more
                            common in the field of independent artists.</p>
                        <p>Due to the lack of editorial control, the process does not even always need to start with a
                            ready plot
                            and
                            script but can start with sketches that evolve into a complete story. But for the sake of
                            comparability,
                            let
                            us start the digital process an independent artist uses with the story creation (plot and
                            potentially
                            script). They then might produce thumbnail layouts of the pages to get an idea of the story
                            flow and the
                            necessary number of panels. This might be done on paper or, already at this stage, on the
                            computer.</p>
                        <p>Then the digital artist completes the final stages with digital tools. Outline art might be
                            drawn
                            similarly
                            to previous techniques with a sketch, a finer rendering of the sketch in more detail, and
                            then the final
                            cleanup. But because they are working digitally, they are not bound to the processes of
                            physical media.
                        </p>
                        <p>After rendering the outlines, the color art can be produced without delay or the need to
                            change medium in
                            the
                            next step. Lettering and sound effects are added. And the page is done.</p>

                        <h3>Comparing the Processes</h3>
                        <p>By contrast, <em>Shatter</em> was limited by the available means of communication, with disks
                            with the
                            digital materials being mailed conventionally. But save for this, the whole process was
                            digital. The
                            limitations of the printing presses made it necessary to produce a hardcopy of the line art
                            so that it
                            could
                            be photographed for the plate-based offset printing of the day. Coloring solely on a
                            computer was not
                            yet
                            feasible on the machines available in 1985, remaining a task to be done by hand the
                            traditional way.

                <h4>1984 wasnâ€™t like 1984</h4>
                <p>In the early 1980s, artist Mike Saenz and writer Peter B. Gillis created the comic book <em>Shatter</em>> using
                    the Apple Macintosh, only just introduced in 1984. This was the very first comic book drawn on a
                    computer using the mouse, at the time a new kind of input device.

                <p class="text-secondary text-center">Figure 1: <em>Shatter,</em> the first comic book created on a computer in 1984</p>

                <p>The production process established in <em>Shatter</em> was a harbinger of things to come and simultaneously
                    showed which components of the process would prove to be a dead end. Unusual for the time, Peter B.
                    Gillis wrote the scripts using a computer and sent them to artist Mike Saenz. Saenz painstakingly
                    drew the comic panels on the Apple Macintosh and placed lettering and sound effects directly in the
                    paint software. The finished pages were printed and then colored traditionally.</p>
                <h4>The Roots of the Art Form</h4>
                <p>
                    In 2018 commercial comic books are drawn using a wide variety of techniques. Most commercial comics
                    are still hand drawn using the traditional process of penciling and inking, but they are then
                    scanned for digital coloring and the digital placement of lettering and sound effects.</p>
                <p>In this paper, we delve into the history of <em>Shatter</em>, the subjects it covers, and the tools used to
                    create its unique art style. We contrast how commercial comic books were created in 1985 with the
                    way <em>Shatter</em> was created. Finally, we plot the path from the process used to create <em>Shatter</em> to the
                    process used to create modern-day commercial comics.

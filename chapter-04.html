                        <p>While Mike Saenz was the first to produce and publish a complete comic book on a computer,
                            other artists
                            quickly followed. In 1988, German comic book artist Michael Götze created the Das Robot
                            Imperium comic
                            album. This was the first European comic created on a computer. He did not use an Apple
                            Macintosh to
                            create
                            this black-and-white comic, but instead the Atari 520ST, an affordable competitor of the Mac
                            that also
                            came
                            with a mouse by default.</p>

                        <h3>Pixel Imperium</h3>
                        <p>The comic's story chronicled the fight of a small group of humans against the robots who
                            ruled over them.
                            Even in the 1980s, this was not the most original plot. Like <em>Shatter</em>, this comic's
                            main selling
                            point was that the artist created it on a computer.</p>
                        <p>Even though the first volume of Das Robot Imperium "Jäger ohne Gewissen" ('Hunter without a
                            conscience")
                            eschews the use of color, it is a far more lavish and elaborate work compared to
                            <em>Shatter</em>. The
                            scenes depicted in the panels have depth and dimensionality. The figures are not flat like
                            in
                            <em>Shatter</em>, Goetze renders the characters' faces with much greater expressiveness. He
                            took much
                            more
                            time to produce each page than the fast release schedule of <em>Shatter</em> would allow.

                        <h3>The Creation Process</h3>
                        <p>On the Atari ST, Götze programmed his own 3D wireframe application and special printing
                            software using
                            GFA-Basic. In the application he called Pixelart, Götze created 3D models of the human body
                            and put them
                            in
                            different poses. Then he combined the figures with flat backgrounds. He also modeled props
                            and
                            mechanical
                            backgrounds like a command center in 3D. Once the 3D models were created, he could place
                            them in the
                            scene
                            and create complicated perspectives with the wireframe models. Eventually, Goetze had a
                            library of
                            objects
                            that he could reuse.</p>
                        <p>He would laboriously touch up the images in the Atari ST paint application D.E.G.A.S. Elite
                            using the
                            mouse
                            to give them the final polish.</p>
                        <p>Work on Robot Imperium started in 1986 on the first of three volumes in the European album
                            format. Götze
                            drew
                            the first volume in black-and-white. The gradients were dot patterns printed with a typical
                            dot-matrix
                            printer used in offices at the time: the Epson FX-80.</p>
                        <p>The back of the first two volumes shows a photo of the artist Götze toiling away on his Atari
                            ST. And the
                            last few pages of the first volume describe Götze's process for drawing the panels on the
                            Atari ST:
                            "This Is
                            How a Comic Is Made on a Computer" ("So entsteht ein Comic am Computer"). From today's
                            perspective, it
                            might
                            appear comedic that the process description includes a short explanation of how a computer
                            mouse works.
                            There even is mention of <em>Shatter</em> by Mike Saenz and Peter B. Gillis (inexplicably,
                            Gillis is
                            referred to as Bernd Gillis in the text). The piece's writer does not show high regard for
                            Saenz'
                            computer
                            art, calling it "unsatisfactory" and "experimental."</p>
                        <p>The most interesting parts of this description were the screenshots of the individual steps
                            in Götze's
                            creation process. They show how he places the rudimentary 3D model of a spaceship over a
                            rough sketch of
                            the
                            background foliage in a forest scene. The wireframes of the spaceship show all sides, even
                            the parts
                            that
                            should be obscured from the viewer. Götze manually cleans up the image, meticulously
                            removing the lines
                            that
                            should not be visible. Then he embellishes the manually-drawn backgrounds, thus integrating
                            them with
                            the 3D
                            model. Then he spots the black areas and emphasizes individual lines to give them more
                            weight. Finally,
                            he
                            shades the image in dotted patterns for different levels of light and dark.</p>
                        <p>Artistically, this painstaking process proved to be very successful. The drawings are very
                            much in the
                            style
                            of the French bandes desinée of the 1980s. This speaks to the artist's craftsmanship. Götze
                            followed the
                            first volume with the second one titled "Volthead" in 1990, this time in full color. It was
                            printed on a
                            dot-matrix printer in multiple passes with different colored ribbons. </p>

                        <h3>The Ghost of A Different Future</h3>
                        <p>In 1992, Götze released the third volume "Ein erster Sieg?" ("A First Victory?") with an even
                            greater
                            level
                            of detail in his drawings and an even greater level of artistic accomplishment. Its
                            slickness moved it
                            so
                            close to the traditionally drawn and colored analog comics to make it indistinguishable at
                            first glance.
                            This also meant that despite all the effort put into it, the comic lost one of its most
                            distinguishing
                            features. It lost the "look" of a computer comic.</p>
                        <p>Commercially, Das Robot Imperium ended up not being very successful. It remains a testimony
                            to artistic
                            dedication, adventurous graphical experimentation, and the stubbornness to make the best use
                            of the
                            capabilities of a barely suitable computer to achieve professional results.</p>

Gillis and Charles Athanas in the mid-1980s on an Apple Macintosh (though with traditional, analog coloring). This milestone of the comics industry paved the way for other digital comics like Das Robot Imperium by Michael Götze and other digital comics."

                While Mike Saenz was the first to produce and publish a complete
                comic book on a computer, other artists quickly followed. In
                1988, German comic book artist Michael Götze created the
                <em>Das Robot Imperium</em> comic album. This was the first
                European comic created on a computer. He did not use an Apple
                Macintosh to create this black-and-white comic, but instead the
                Atari 520ST, an affordable competitor of the Mac that also came
                with a mouse by default.

              <p>
                The comic's story chronicled the fight of a small group of
                humans against the robots who ruled over them. Even in the
                1980s, this was not the most original plot. Like
                <em>Shatter</em>, this comic's main selling point was that the
                artist created it on a computer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even though the first volume of
                <em>Das Robot Imperium</em> "Jäger ohne Gewissen" ('Hunter
                without a conscience") eschews the use of color, it is a far
                more lavish and elaborate work compared to <em>Shatter</em>. The
                scenes depicted in the panels have depth and dimensionality. The
                figures are not flat like in <em>Shatter</em>, Goetze renders
                the characters' faces with much greater expressiveness. He took
                much more time to produce each page than the fast release
                schedule of <em>Shatter</em> would allow.

              <p>
                On the Atari ST, Götze programmed his own 3D wireframe
                application and special printing software using
                <em>GFA-Basic.</em> In the application he called
                <em>Pixelart,</em> Götze created 3D models of the human body and
                put them in different poses. Then he combined the figures with
                flat backgrounds. He also modeled props and mechanical
                backgrounds like a command center in 3D. Once the 3D models were
                created, he could place them in the scene and create complicated
                perspectives with the wireframe models. Eventually, Goetze had a
                library of objects that he could reuse.
              </p>
              <p>
                He would laboriously touch up the images in the Atari ST paint
                application <em>D.E.G.A.S. Elite</em> using the mouse to give
                them the final polish.
              </p>
              <p>
                Work on <em>Robot Imperium</em> started in 1986 on the first of
                three volumes in the European album format. Götze drew the first
                volume in black-and-white. The gradients were dot patterns
                printed with a typical dot-matrix printer used in offices at the
                time: the Epson FX-80.
              </p>
              <p>
                The back of the first two volumes shows a photo of the artist
                Götze toiling away on his Atari ST. And the last few pages of
                the first volume describe Götze's process for drawing the panels
                on the Atari ST: "This Is How a Comic Is Made on a Computer"
                ("So entsteht ein Comic am Computer"). From today's perspective,
                it might appear comedic that the process description includes a
                short explanation of how a computer mouse works. There even is
                mention of <em>Shatter</em> by Mike Saenz and Peter B. Gillis
                (inexplicably, Gillis is referred to as Bernd Gillis in the
                text). The piece's writer does not show high regard for Saenz'
                computer art, calling it "unsatisfactory" and "experimental."
              </p>
              <p>
                The most interesting parts of this description were the
                screenshots of the individual steps in Götze's creation process.
                They show how he places the rudimentary 3D model of a spaceship
                over a rough sketch of the background foliage in a forest scene.
                The wireframes of the spaceship show all sides, even the parts
                that should be obscured from the viewer. Götze manually cleans
                up the image, meticulously removing the lines that should not be
                visible. Then he embellishes the manually-drawn backgrounds,
                thus integrating them with the 3D model. Then he spots the black
                areas and emphasizes individual lines to give them more weight.
                Finally, he shades the image in dotted patterns for different
                levels of light and dark.
              </p>
              <p>
                Artistically, this painstaking process proved to be very
                successful. The drawings are very much in the style of the
                French bandes desinée of the 1980s. This speaks to the artist's
                craftsmanship. Götze followed the first volume with the second
                one titled "Volthead" in 1990, this time in full color. It was
                printed on a dot-matrix printer in multiple passes with
                different colored ribbons.

              <p>
                In 1992, Götze released the third volume "Ein erster Sieg?" ("A
                First Victory?") with an even greater level of detail in his
                drawings and an even greater level of artistic accomplishment.
                Its slickness moved it so close to the traditionally drawn and
                colored analog comics to make it indistinguishable at first
                glance. This also meant that despite all the effort put into it,
                the comic lost one of its most distinguishing features. It lost
                the "look" of a computer comic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Commercially, Das Robot Imperium ended up not being very
                successful. It remains a testimony to artistic dedication,
                adventurous graphical experimentation, and the stubbornness to
                make the best use of the capabilities of a barely suitable
                computer to achieve professional results.

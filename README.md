# Project Shatter, the First Computer Comic

This is a paper I wrote for university in 2018 about _Shatter_, a comic book created by Mike Saenz, Peter B. Gillis and Charles Athanas in the mid-1980s on an Apple Macintosh (though the coloring is done traditionally in an analog manner).

This milestone of the comics industry started out successfully but ran its course after 14 issues. It paved the way for other digital comics like _Das Robot Imperium_ by Michael GÃ¶tze, _Iron Man: Crash_ by Mike Saenz and _Batman: Digital Justice_ by Pepe Moreno.

This paper discusses the series, its contents, the process used to create it and its successor comics.

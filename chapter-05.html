              The Importance of <em>Shatter</em> as Media Art
            </h3>
            <p>
              <em>Shatter</em> is very much of its time. The
              computer-generated art from the mid-80s is stiff and
              un-lifelike. At the same time, it shows a mad energy that comes
              from artists discovering what a piece of equipment can do beyond
              what anyone thought before them. This energy might be fueled by
              the intention to subvert the traditional comics production
              process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The art style is primitive by nowadays standards, but it is most
              definitely the star of the series compared to the
              run-of-the-mill story content. It is still visually interesting
              to look at each page and wonder at the intricacies that Mike
              Saenz and Charlie Athanas were able to eke out of their
              Macintosh.
            </p>
            <p>
              While only modestly entertaining as a piece of commercial
              entertainment, <em>Shatter</em> is a cultural artifact and a
              relic of a long-bygone era, with a good helping of quirkiness
              and originality in execution. It shows the evolutionary step
              taken to where technology has brought us today. To stay in
              evolutionary terms, this comic book is the fish whose fins more
              resemble legs, even though it has not yet fully left the sea. In
              essence, the idea of <em>Shatter</em> is fascinating. The idea
              that one day, comics might be produced digitally, but in 1985
              Mike Saenz and Peter B. Gillis (and later Charlie Athanas) were
              impatient and did not want to wait for technology to catch up
              with their aspirations.

              Archiving <em>Shatter</em> for Media Arts Histories
            </h3>
            <p>
              Even though <em>Shatter</em> was produced digitally, it was
              always targeted at being printed. Its creators and the
              publishing company sought to print it and distribute it as a
              physical product. Preservation of individual printed copies is
              subject to the same principles as preserving other kinds of
              print media and periodicals: temperature- and moisture-regulated
              archives and a complete absence of light during storage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from the physical medium, <em>Shatter</em> is one of the
              earliest artifacts with the raw content available as digital
              files. Unfortunately, the demise of First Comics Publishing has
              made it unlikely for us to use this venue to obtain the original
              digital files in the MacPaint format. It is certainly possible
              to seek out the files from the original artists. The physical
              media the files are stored on (disks or hard disks) might
              already be corrupted after three decades of storage. If the
              files can be found, then they can be archived in distributed
              storage systems such as a cloud or a raid setup. In one of the
              letters columns, the editor notes that for a small handling fee,
              the publishing company would be prepared to send a disk with
              digital artwork to interested parties. If any readers made use
              of this, then digital copies might be stored away on disks
              somewhere in the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from the files generated during production, there might
              even be an animated digital trailer. According to one source,
              the original artist even put together something of the kind that
              was distributed on a disk<sup><a id="shatter-chapter-5-footnote-origin-15" href="#shatter-chapter-5-footnote-15">[15]</a></sup>. These might also still be available.
            </p>
            <p>It exceeds the mandate of this paper to locate them.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-5">Learning from <em>Shatter</em></h3>
            <p>
              One might argue that it is not a matter of whether
              <em>Shatter</em> is a good piece of entertainment, an
              accomplished piece of art, or the culmination of a cultural
              discipline. Even at the time of its creation, it never pretended
              or aspired to be any of this. To many, <em>Shatter</em> exudes
              the strange fascination that Eadweard Muybridge's sequential
              photography of galloping horses and walking men and women in
              Victorian times manifests, even though we have contemporary 4K
              footage of the same motifs in much higher quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              It can even be argued that <em>Shatter</em> is not an artifact
              from the past that has had a great influence on how we create
              and even read comics today. Its reach was not great enough to
              have done so. But the technology it employed at the time
              certainly had taken its first steps towards the total
              digitization of the visual arts. Today we have become used to
              seeing computer-generated graphics in film, in commercial art,
              and in comics. The creators of <em>Shatter</em> were the first
              to see these possibilities in the available hardware before it
              was capable enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we run original Macintosh software in emulation, software
              such as MacPaint, MacDraw, and FullPaint, it is easy to lose
              sight of the context it was used in at the time. Perhaps,
              <em>Shatter</em> can open our eyes to this context. We shouldn't
              frown upon software's limitations but recognize how artists in
              the past used it for actual honest-to-God production work. They
              did not see the restrictions, rather they saw the potential for
              experimentation. And all of this with the pressure of
              publication deadlines looming.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exploring <em>Shatter</em> not only shows us the achievements of
              the creators but also their omissions, failings, and blind
              spots: They did not make any use of the nascent 3D graphics
              already taking shape on the 16-Bit machines of the time. In the
              year of <em>Shatter</em>'s cancellation, comics artist Michael
              Goetze, from Germany, had already been making use of 3D graphics
              in his electronic comic <em>Das Robot Imperium</em> (Carlsen
              Comics, 1988) on the Atari ST, a 16-Bit computer of a similar
              generation as the Apple Macintosh.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is easy to take <em>Shatter</em> at face value and only see
              its clunkiness, its deficiencies, and the ineptitude in its
              execution. As an audience and perhaps even as fellow artists, we
              can all instead look at <em>Shatter</em> and ask ourselves how
              much time and effort Mike Saenz and Charlie Athanas have put
              into the work. At any point in their creative process, they had
              the opportunity to give up and abandon this tedious and
              thankless exercise. Perhaps, at some point, each one of them
              stepped back from the nine-inch screen, with its monochrome line
              art, and shook their heads, thinking how much effort they had
              put into this work that to some audiences might look bad or
              even, as Mike Gold put it, like "some amphetamine addict had
              been given a box of a zip-a-tone." Maybe they thought how much
              easier it might have been to take pencil and pen to paper
              instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              And perhaps they knew how "cool" they were, and perhaps they
              felt how subversive their art was because they were at the
              technological razor's edge in a world not yet ready for it.

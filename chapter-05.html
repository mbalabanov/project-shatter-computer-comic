                The Importance of <em>Shatter</em> as Media Art
              </h3>
              <p>
                <em>Shatter</em> is very much of its time. The
                computer-generated art from the mid-80s is stiff and
                un-lifelike. At the same time, it shows a mad energy that comes
                from artists discovering what a piece of equipment can do beyond
                what anyone thought before them. This energy might be fueled by
                the intention to subvert the traditional comics production
                process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The art style is primitive by nowadays standards, but it is most
                definitely the star of the series compared to the
                run-of-the-mill story content. It is still visually interesting
                to look at each page and wonder at the intricacies that Mike
                Saenz and Charlie Athanas were able to eke out of their
                Macintosh.
              </p>
              <p>
                While only modestly entertaining as a piece of commercial
                entertainment, <em>Shatter</em> is a cultural artifact and a
                relic of a long-bygone era, with a good helping of quirkiness
                and originality in execution. It shows the evolutionary step
                taken to where technology has brought us today. To stay in
                evolutionary terms, this comic book is the fish whose fins more
                resemble legs, even though it has not yet fully left the sea. In
                essence, the idea of <em>Shatter</em> is fascinating. The idea
                that one day, comics might be produced digitally, but in 1985
                Mike Saenz and Peter B. Gillis (and later Charlie Athanas) were
                impatient and did not want to wait for technology to catch up
                with their aspirations.

                Archiving <em>Shatter</em> for Media Arts Histories
              </h3>
              <p>
                Even though <em>Shatter</em> was produced digitally, it was
                always targeted at being printed. Its creators and the
                publishing company sought to print it and distribute it as a
                physical product. Preservation of individual printed copies is
                subject to the same principles as preserving other kinds of
                print media and periodicals: temperature- and moisture-regulated
                archives and a complete absence of light during storage.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aside from the physical medium, <em>Shatter</em> is one of the
                earliest artifacts with the raw content available as digital
                files. Unfortunately, the demise of First Comics Publishing has
                made it unlikely for us to use this venue to obtain the original
                digital files in the MacPaint format. It is certainly possible
                to seek out the files from the original artists. The physical
                media the files are stored on (disks or hard disks) might
                already be corrupted after three decades of storage. If the
                files can be found, then they can be archived in distributed
                storage systems such as a cloud or a raid setup. In one of the
                letters columns, the editor notes that for a small handling fee,
                the publishing company would be prepared to send a disk with
                digital artwork to interested parties. If any readers made use
                of this, then digital copies might be stored away on disks
                somewhere in the United States.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from the files generated during production, there might
                even be an animated digital trailer. According to one source,
                the original artist even put together something of the kind that
                was distributed on a disk<sup

              <h3 class="mt-5">Learning from <em>Shatter</em></h3>
              <p>
                One might argue that it is not a matter of whether
                <em>Shatter</em> is a good piece of entertainment, an
                accomplished piece of art, or the culmination of a cultural
                discipline. Even at the time of its creation, it never pretended
                or aspired to be any of this. To many, <em>Shatter</em> exudes
                the strange fascination that Eadweard Muybridge's sequential
                photography of galloping horses and walking men and women in
                Victorian times manifests, even though we have contemporary 4K
                footage of the same motifs in much higher quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                It can even be argued that <em>Shatter</em> is not an artifact
                from the past that has had a great influence on how we create
                and even read comics today. Its reach was not great enough to
                have done so. But the technology it employed at the time
                certainly had taken its first steps towards the total
                digitization of the visual arts. Today we have become used to
                seeing computer-generated graphics in film, in commercial art,
                and in comics. The creators of <em>Shatter</em> were the first
                to see these possibilities in the available hardware before it
                was capable enough.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we run original Macintosh software in emulation, software
                such as MacPaint, MacDraw, and FullPaint, it is easy to lose
                sight of the context it was used in at the time. Perhaps,
                <em>Shatter</em> can open our eyes to this context. We shouldn't
                frown upon software's limitations but recognize how artists in
                the past used it for actual honest-to-God production work. They
                did not see the restrictions, rather they saw the potential for
                experimentation. And all of this with the pressure of
                publication deadlines looming.
              </p>
              <p>
                Exploring <em>Shatter</em> not only shows us the achievements of
                the creators but also their omissions, failings, and blind
                spots: They did not make any use of the nascent 3D graphics
                already taking shape on the 16-Bit machines of the time. In the
                year of <em>Shatter</em>'s cancellation, comics artist Michael
                Goetze, from Germany, had already been making use of 3D graphics
                in his electronic comic <em>Das Robot Imperium</em> (Carlsen
                Comics, 1988) on the Atari ST, a 16-Bit computer of a similar
                generation as the Apple Macintosh.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is easy to take <em>Shatter</em> at face value and only see
                its clunkiness, its deficiencies, and the ineptitude in its
                execution. As an audience and perhaps even as fellow artists, we
                can all instead look at <em>Shatter</em> and ask ourselves how
                much time and effort Mike Saenz and Charlie Athanas have put
                into the work. At any point in their creative process, they had
                the opportunity to give up and abandon this tedious and
                thankless exercise. Perhaps, at some point, each one of them
                stepped back from the nine-inch screen, with its monochrome line
                art, and shook their heads, thinking how much effort they had
                put into this work that to some audiences might look bad or
                even, as Mike Gold put it, like "some amphetamine addict had
                been given a box of a zip-a-tone." Maybe they thought how much
                easier it might have been to take pencil and pen to paper
                instead.
              </p>
              <p>
                And perhaps they knew how "cool" they were, and perhaps they
                felt how subversive their art was because they were at the
                technological razor's edge in a world not yet ready for it.

                        <p><sup>5</sup> Gibson, W. (1982). "Burning Chrome." Collected in Burning Chrome. (1986). New
                            York: Arbor

                        <p><sup>6</sup> The statement is put in relative terms because there is no quote about this from
                            the
                            original artist Mike Saenz, only from artist Charlie Athanas who succeeded Saenz a year
                            after the
                            latter’s departure. The quote from Charlie Athanas: "... the hard part was the fact that you
                            could
                            only see about two-thirds of a full page at any one time, unless you shrunk it to a postage
                            stamp size
                            thumbnail. Covers and splash pages, especially double-page splash pages, were a layout
                            nightmare."</p>

                        <p><sup>10</sup> The same pages were later used as part of the Shatter back-up feature in Jon
                            Sable #25. It
                            is important to note that the back-up feature in Jon Sable was published after the Shatter
                            Special #1
                            which itself precedes the stories published in Jon Sable in chronology.</p>

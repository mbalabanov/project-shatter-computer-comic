                Nowadays, computers are prolific. Pretty much everyone has one
                in their pockets in the shape of a smartphone. Some people even
                wear computers. Digital technology is everywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we turn the dial back to 1984, we see that computers were
                still thought of as a science-fiction device. While kids loved
                their video games, adults regarded computers with awe. At the
                time, few understood what they were capable of then or how
                transformative they would be in all areas of life going forward.
                Only two years prior, William Gibson had coined the term
                "cyberspace." The writer had published his debut novel
                <em>Neuromancer,</em> a book that led a wave of excitement about
                the possibilities of computers. In 1984 Apple founder Steve Jobs
                introduced the first Macintosh computer.

                Colliding at the Cross-Section of Art and Technology
              </h3>
              <p>
                It seemed that the Apple Macintosh was destined for graphics
                work, for art. At its launch, Apple made programs available such
                as MacPaint and MacDraw. This opened up a world of possibilities
                for artists and for computer-assisted art and design.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout the history of comics, writers and artists have
                experimented with the medium in a multitude of ways. They have
                developed artistic techniques to change existing conventions
                into something new. Through changes in the culture around them,
                they have seen new perspectives and depicted the cognitive shift
                in their work. In the early 1980s, comics grew stale and timid.
                The mainstream titles such as <em>The Uncanny X-Men</em> and
                <em>The New Teen Titans</em> had turned from the daring upstarts
                to the status quo. Not only audiences but also the artists
                producing comic books had a constant hunger for something fresh
                and exciting.

                The advent of the first affordable graphics computer, the
                zeitgeist of cyberpunk, and the hunger for new visuals and
                storytelling collided at the cross section of technology and
                art. In 1985 they converged to create <em>Shatter</em>, the
                first digitally produced comic book.

              <h3 class="mt-5">What Is <em>Shatter</em> About?</h3>
              <p>
                First Comics Publishing's <em>Shatter</em> was created by artist
                Mike Saenz and writer Peter B. Gillis. It is a self-described
                tech-noir thriller, the story of the private eye Sadr al-Din
                Morales, commonly referred to as <em>Shatter</em>. The story is
                very much of its time. Much of it stands on the shoulders of
                works such as Ridley Scott's 1982 film <em>Bladerunner</em> and
                Gibson's novel <em>Neuromancer.</em> In its own campy way,
                <em>Shatter</em> discusses concepts that are nowadays common and
                perhaps even quaint, such as the dangers of technology in a
                dystopian future and the distrust of corporations. In its own
                way, the book eschews the main subject matter of mainstream
                comic books by aspiring to be cyberpunk without explicitly
                claiming to be it. Cyberpunk, we remember, is the grim and
                gritty science fiction sub-genre. This "combination of lowlife
                and high tech" (as described by Bruce Sterling in his preface to
                William Gibson's <em>Burning Chrome</em>) features advanced
                technology, such as global networks, brain-computer interfaces,
                and artificial intelligence, all coexisting and competing with
                the radical breakdown of social order, as only the early 1980s
                could imagine.

              <p>
                The protagonist, <em>Shatter</em>, takes on the job of tracking
                down a serial killer who killed the board members of a large
                corporation. When he finds her, she reveals to him that the
                corporation uses human RNA to transfer the skill sets of people
                to others. Our hero finds himself involved with the underground
                movement dedicated to stopping this practice. In a surprising
                turn of events, <em>Shatter</em> finds out that he has "golden
                brain" that keeps any RNA-induced talents indefinitely without
                losing them, as everyone else does eventually.
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Shatter</em> occasionally veers toward the prophetic when it
                depicts our protagonist bidding on a "gig" to take a case,
                hinting at today's emerging "gig economy," as found on
                fiverr.com and upwork.com. Other concepts sound unrealistic but
                not completely out of the question, such as splicing talents
                into a person's RNA to give them the special abilities of a
                gifted artist, athlete, or businessman.
              </p>
              <p>
                But the story is not what makes <em>Shatter</em> special. It is
                the process of its creation.

              <p>
                Finding a true "first" is never cut and dry, so calling
                <em>Shatter</em> the first digitally produced comic might not be
                completely true. If we dig deeply into the Bulletin Board System
                (BBS) culture of the late 70s to early 80s, the precursor to the
                web and the internet as we know it today, we will find users who
                had distributed digitally produced comics as ASCII art,
                semigraphics, or even as digitized captures of analog art. That
                being said, <em>Shatter</em> deserves one commendation for being
                "first": It definitely was the first commercially available
                digitally produced comic book.

                In 1985 <em>Shatter</em> showed that the potential for
                computer-assisted comic-book art was a reality. The art for
                publication was drawn by hand on the computer as opposed to
                later methods of scanning in inked pages for digital coloring.
                Publisher First Comics Publishing had a potential hit on their
                hands—a hit through the novelty of new technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Artist Mike Saenz started with a series of rough pencil sketches
                for each page. These were reviewed by the editors of the comic.
                When approved, Saenz drew the comic pages on a Macintosh Plus
                with 1MB RAM using MacPaint and MacDraw. The pages were saved on
                a disk drive with floppies holding a paltry 800 KB. The greatest
                challenge was drawing on the nine-inch monochrome screen with a
                resolution of 512 x 342 pixels. The screen was so small that the
                artist could only see and work on a section of the current page
                (by some accounts, two-thirds of the page<sup
                  ><a
                    id="shatter-chapter-2-footnote-origin-6"

                  ></sup
                >). Saenz drew the pages using the standard Mac mouse; there
                were no scanners available to capture analog art, and the
                artists of <em>Shatter</em> only procured digitizer tablets at a
                later time.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the first issues, the artist printed the pages on an Apple
                dot-matrix ImageWriter. In late 1985, when the regular series
                launched, Apple donated a LaserWriter.

              <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
                Better still, Apple came out with their LaserWriter, an
                unbelievable printer that produces crisp, sharp printouts of
                Mike's work. For graphics art reproduction, the difference
                between the LaserWriter and traditional dot-matrix printers is
                like the difference between glossy coffee-table art books and
                paintings on cave walls. And better still, the folks up at Apple
                <strong>gave</strong> us a LaserWriter. That sucker isn't
                exactly cheap; it's nice to know you're appreciated. Thanks,

                The LaserWriter enabled Adobe PostScript font styles for
                typesetting text and made illustration graphics smoother and
                less pixelated because of the device's powerful interpolation.

                The three people most closely identified with
                <em>Shatter</em> are artist Mike Saenz, writer Peter B. Gillis
                (both of whom created the series), and artist Charlie Athanas,
                who joined the publication in issue #8.

                Chicago-born artist Mike Saenz started work on
                <em>Shatter</em> at the age of 26. The book was among his first
                professional work and served as his breakthrough. After working
                on <em>Shatter</em>, Saenz went on to produce digital comics for
                Marvel and to work in software development.<sup

                Peter B. Gillis was an established comics writer when he started
                work on <em>Shatter</em> at the age of 32. He had freelanced for
                Marvel Comics with his first published story in
                <em>Captain America.</em> After numerous credits in Marvel's
                second-tier comic books, Gillis went on to work as an editor for
                the Florida-based publisher New Media Publishing until 1981. His
                first work for First Comics Publishing was the science-fiction
                series <em>Warp</em> until 1985. Then he joined the team of

              <p>
                In the early 1980s, publisher First Comics Publishing was one of
                the few alternatives to the "big two": Marvel Comics (<em
                  >Spider-Man,</em
                >
                <em>X-Men,</em> <em>Avengers</em>) and DC Comics (<em
                  >Superman,</em
                >
                <em>Batman,</em> <em>Wonder Woman</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Shatter</em> saw its first printing in the British computer
                games magazine <em>Big K,</em> issue #12, its last issue before
                it ceased publication. It was a four-page story printed in black
                and white.<sup

                The series was touted as "the first computerized comic."
                According to one report, Saenz and Gillis had offered the series
                to Marvel Comics, who declined; only then was it picked up by
                First Comics Publishing.<sup

              <p>
                After its debut, <em>Shatter</em> went on to be published by
                First Comics Publishing (Chicago) as a back-up feature to the
                ongoing comic series <em>Jon Sable.</em> These eight-page
                installments ran from issues #25 to #30 of the
                <em>Jon Sable</em> series. The feature proved to be so popular
                that publisher First Comics decided to release a
                <em>Shatter</em> special issue with 28 original story pages by
                Mike Saenz and Peter B. Gillis.

                It sold 100,000 copies in three days, breaking the existing
                sales records for independent comic books. In 1985 a
                high-selling issue of Marvel Comics's
                <em>The Uncanny X-Men</em> sold 300,000 copies. By comparison,
                sales of <em>Shatter</em> were very impressive for an
                independent comics publisher.
              </p>
              <p>
                First Comics commissioned an ongoing series. At this point,
                writer Peter B. Gillis had moved on, so the artist Mike Saenz
                started to not only draw the book but also provide the plot and
                script.
              </p>

                The first issue of the ongoing <em>Shatter</em> series sold
                60,000 copies. After releasing issue #2, Mike Saenz left his
                creation to work on other projects. In 1988 he would go on to
                produce the full-color digital graphic novel
                <em>Iron Man: Crash</em> for Marvel Comics and work on the comic
                creation app ComicWorks before being bought out by software
                maker Macromedia.

              <p>
                This paper was written in 2018. Now, more than 30 years later,
                it is difficult to assess what the original audience reaction
                was at the time of publication. The few remaining reviews show
                very positive feedback lauding the use of the Macintosh. In
                hindsight, much of the praise is directed towards the promised
                potential of digital art and not always the results on display
                at the time.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the series' letters pages, readers criticized the story for
                being a derivative of <em>Blade Runner.</em> In issue #2, one
                reader writes:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
                "The only thing bad about it is the story. It does not make much
                sense and the whole thing is terrible."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                While the digital art did find a lot of praise ("The graphics
                inside are excellent" from the letters column in issue #2), it
                was not universally praised, as can be seen in this letter from
                the same issue:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
                "The graphics in <em>Shatter</em> are likely to be more of a
                turn off to potential computer comic connoisseurs due to their
                primitive quality and unimaginative execution."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The oddest reactions still available in their original form are
                from the letters pages of the series. First Comics Publishing
                advertised the digital nature of the series and went to great
                lengths to explain the process in its editorial pages.
                Nevertheless, in issue #3, a reader writes that they doubt that
                the art was, in fact, produced on a computer:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
                I'm not accusing you of doing anything yet, but a lot of
                <em>Shatter</em> #1 looked like it wasn't quite done by computer
                ... The curves in the walls are just too perfect, even for a
                computer ... I figure if you're going to do a comic on a
                computer, you ought to make it look like a computer drawing, not
                like a drawing done by hand.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The editor responded that for a small fee they would be happy to
                send a disk to the reader with the original artwork in its
                digital form as proof.

                After moving on to DC Comics, Mike Gold, the original editor of
                <em>Shatter</em>, reminisced about the series in the
                introduction of DC's own digital comic effort
                <em>Batman: Digital Justice</em> in 1990 (emphasis provided by
                the writer of this paper):
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
                At that time, I was the editor of a midwest comic book company
                when a couple of old friends, Peter Gillis and Mike Saenz,
                showed me rough printouts of a story that was produced on a 128
                K Apple Macintosh computer, using but one disk drive. The
                artwork was chunky and brittle: it looked like
                <em
                  >some amphetamine addict had been given a box of a zip-a-tone
                  that suffered from a glandular disease.</em
                >
                But the look was totally unique to comics. Within several
                months, we refined the look and the resulting effort
                <em>Shatter</em> was one of the best-selling comics of the year.
                It completely astonished the folks over at Apple Computer, Inc.,
                who never perceived such a use for their hardware.

              <p>
                Ultimately, <em>Shatter</em> would run for 14 issues from 1985
                to 1988, but in 1986, after Mike Saenz left, First Comics
                Publishing did not want its successful series to suffer delay.
                Not to leave the series without a writer and an artist, Steven
                Grant jumped in to fill the writer's role for issues #3 and #4
                while Steve Erwin and Bob Dienenthal took over the art chores
                for issues #3 to #7.

              <p>
                The art in these issues was workable but no longer special
                because the artists penciled and inked traditionally and had
                their pages scanned into the Macintosh to be lettered in
                MacPaint. This deprived <em>Shatter</em> of its special look.
                The art degraded to standard comic book art, albeit strongly
                pixelated to suggest that computers remained a vital part of the
                production process.
              </p>
              <p>
                At least in issue #5, original writer Peter B. Gillis returned
                to the fold to give the story focus and the dialog edge. But
                <em>Shatter</em> would still need another couple of issues
                before it could hit its stride with a new artist coming on
                board.

                The departure of Mike Saenz left <em>Shatter</em> without its
                main selling point: art drawn directly on a computer. The book
                needed to return to its unique art style. It needed a new artist

                floppy drive. Only about two-thirds of a full page was visible
                to work on unless you switched to thumbnail mode to see the
                entire page on a drastically reduced scale. About half the
                issues were drawn with the standard Mac mouse until a small
                drawing tablet became commercially available.

                Athanas re-established drawing directly on the Macintosh Plus
                with the computer mouse. To speed up publication efficiency,
                Athanas drafted rough pencil sketches in order to sketch out
                layout design, speed up the writing of the script, and go
                through editorial review.

                Without scanners at his disposal, Athanas manually redrew the
                rough sketches directly on this Mac. Now that the series was
                back to computer-drawn artwork, the pages had a much cleaner art
                style. Athanas not only used MacPaint but also FullPaint by Ann
                Arbor Softworks.

                <em>Shatter</em> was saved for the time being. Sales stabilized
                with the new creative team. But alas, technology progressed at a
                breakneck pace in the mid to late 80s. The home-computer
                revolution had started to sweep computers into every American
                household. A comic series about a dystopian future no longer
                captured its readers' imaginations. With issue #12, Peter B.
                Gillis left as a writer to be succeeded by Jay Case. First
                Comics Publishing met with financial difficulties, and the
                series' novelty of new technology wore off. Sales started to
                slip, and by 1988 they had dropped sufficiently to make the
                publication no longer viable. First Comics Publishing allowed
                the creators to complete their story but no longer start a new
                one. <em>Shatter</em> was cancelled with issue #14.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus ended the first sustained experiment in commercial
                digital-art production after three tumultuous years. By then,
                editor Mike Gold had left for DC Comics, leaving editor Rick
                Oliver to write the last words for the series in the letters
                page of <em>Shatter</em> #14 (cover date April 1988):

                When <em>Shatter</em> first appeared, it was produced solely
                with the software that came packaged with the Macintosh; Apple's
                own MacPaint. More recently, we have also incorporated MacDraw,
                Word, Switcher, MacBillboard, and FullPaint. This letters column
                and the First Notes page were produced with Word and XPress, an
                electronic page make-up program.

                There are more new graphics programs available every day, each
                more sophisticated than the last, and there's no telling where
                it will all lead.
              </p>
              <p>
                But for now, <em>Shatter</em> has served its purpose, and it's
                time to move on. Thanks to all our loyal readers who stuck it
                out through both the great and the not-so-great issues. Thanks
                to Peter Gillis and Mike Saenz for starting the ball rolling,
                Steve Erwin and Bob Dienethal for keeping it going and finally,
                let's give a big hand for Charlie Athanas for revitalizing the
                book for a classy finish.

                The technology might not yet have been advanced enough, but
                <em>Shatter</em> proved one thing to the comic book industry:
                comics could be produced digitally, and dots by any other name
                could still be art.

                year after the latter's departure. The quote from Charlie
                Athanas: "... the hard part was the fact that you could only see
                about two-thirds of a full page at any one time, unless you
                shrunk it to a postage stamp size thumbnail. Covers and splash

              In the early 1980s, artist Mike Saenz and writer Peter B. Gillis
              created the comic book <em>Shatter</em>> using the Apple
              Macintosh, only just introduced in 1984. This was the very first
              comic book drawn on a computer using the mouse, at the time a
              new kind of input device.

              components of the process would prove to be a dead end. Unusual
              for the time, Peter B. Gillis wrote the scripts using a computer
              and sent them to artist Mike Saenz. Saenz painstakingly drew the
              comic panels on the Apple Macintosh and placed lettering and
              sound effects directly in the paint software. The finished pages
              were printed and then colored traditionally.

            <p>
              In 2018 commercial comic books are drawn using a wide variety of
              techniques. Most commercial comics are still hand drawn using
              the traditional process of penciling and inking, but they are
              then scanned for digital coloring and the digital placement of
              lettering and sound effects.

              In this paper, we delve into the history of <em>Shatter</em>,
              the subjects it covers, and the tools used to create its unique
              art style. We contrast how commercial comic books were created
              in 1985 with the way <em>Shatter</em> was created. Finally, we
              plot the path from the process used to create
              <em>Shatter</em> to the process used to create modern-day
              commercial comics.

              In the 1960s American comics changed. They were always regarded
              as shrill, cheap, and trashy, with dropping sales in the past
              decade. Yet at their core, they became subversive, in tune with
              the rising counterculture of the 1960s. This decade brought a
              cultural explosion: questioning traditional modes of authority,
              protests against the war in Vietnam, a vocal youth culture, new
              music, widespread social tensions, liberated sexuality, women's
              rights, experimentation with psychoactive drugs<sup><a id="shatter-chapter-1-footnote-origin-1"

              In his seminal work

                ,</em>
              Scott McCloud describes comics as "juxtaposed pictorial and
              other images in a deliberate sequence, intended to convey
              information and/or produce an aesthetic response in the viewer."

              As an art form, they were much more than that; they were an echo
              of the world around them. And in the 1960s they transformed
              along two different lines: commercial comics and the "comix
              underground."

            <p>
              By the 1960s "mainstream" comics were firmly set in the
              superhero genre. DC Comics, the industry's top dog, with its
              stable of superheroes such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman
              was being challenged by upstart Marvel comics. The work of
              writer Stan Lee and artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko subverted
              the comics mainstream that was traditionally oriented towards
              children. They introduced superheroes who appealed to older
              readers, breaking convention with other archetypes of the time
              by showing characters with personal flaws, who quarreled with
              their peers, and who lived in the eventful world of the 1960s.

              Randy Roberts and James S. Olson wrote that "Marvel Comics

              In comics series such as <em>Fantastic Four</em>,
              <em>Doctor Strange</em>, and <em>Silver Surfer</em>, Kirby,
              Ditko, and Lee plotted grand "cosmic" ideas about
              extraterrestrial civilizations, different dimensions,
              personified embodiments of abstract notions, whole human
              cultures hidden from the world, and alien gods. Many of these
              concepts were exaggerated ideas previously encountered in
              science fiction, but the way the Marvel artists depicted it,
              much of the imagery was psychedelic and on a cosmic scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              The comics published at Marvel managed the then unique bridge
              between the absurdly grand and the humbly human. Simply put,
              Marvel comics were a breath of fresh air.

            <p>
              The second component of the one-two punch of the comics
              renaissance of the 1960s was underground comix (yes, spelled
              with an "x"). These small-press or self-published comic books
              often covered socially relevant issues in a satirical manner.
              Their art style flew in the face of the established superhero
              comics, ranging from deliberately dilettante to classically
              rendered or even caricature. Underground comix were not bound by
              the restrictions of other printed media, often openly depicting
              sexuality, explicit drug use, and violence.

              Underground comix subverted the limitations of the comics medium

            <h3 class="mt-5">Technology and Art</h3>
            <p>
              To a certain extent, it is fair to say that drawing and
              distributing comics is not merely a function of art but very
              much of technology. It only became feasible to easily produce
              and distribute comic books once the process of printing became
              widely enough available and cheap enough to warrant it.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the reasons for the widespread adoption of comic books as
              a creative outlet was that creating a comic book took far fewer
              resources than other mediums. Making a movie back in the 1960s
              was an expensive and time-consuming endeavor, and getting a film
              distributed was often an insurmountable hurdle for fledgling
              filmmakers.
            </p>
            <p>
              To create a comic book, all you needed were pencil and paper,
              pen and ink . . . and something to say, a story to tell. Of
              course, if you wanted to touch the souls of your readers, you
              also needed talent. Even in the 1960s, finding and paying for a
              printer for the low print runs in black and white on cheap paper
              was feasible, if not always easy. To get something printed in
              color was far more expensive, and you would usually have to go
              to an established publisher.
            </p>
            <p>
              Underground artists could distribute their finished product
              themselves by using the many record stores or comics specialty
              shops in large metropolitan areas. Established publishers could
              default to newsstand distribution or mainstream retail outlets.

            <h3 class="mt-5">No Creative Limits</h3>
            <p>
              While printing technology and publishing have evolved over time,
              the core process of creating comics has not changed a lot. You
              tell a story in panels, usually rectangular sections that
              progress across the page with glimpses of what is happening with
              characters, objects, and locations drawn in them. Exposition and
              dialogue are lettered into boxes and speech bubbles. You even
              have a mechanism to show the thoughts of characters as clouds
              hovering close to their heads.
            </p>
            <p>
              Potentially, it only takes a single writer-artist to create a
              comic story. The creator thinks of a story plot and sketches it
              out roughly, either as thumbnail images or directly on the page
              where they will draw the artwork. Usually, the original artwork
              is in a format much larger than the printed result; the process
              of reducing it in print brings out the details.
            </p>
            <p>
              While a single individual <em>could</em> do everything
              themselves, and many have in the past, the process is most
              likely split up among more creators. A writer would write the
              plot and the dialog. A penciler sketches out the character,
              settings, and locations in the panels on a page, focusing on
              getting proportions and perspective right and telling the story
              the writer describes in their script. The inker takes the
              penciled pages and gives the pale lines weight, the depicted
              objects and characters texture, and even corrects the occasional
              lapse in the pencil. A letterer puts in the speech bubbles,
              captions, and thought balloons and adds sound effects where
              necessary. And finally, a color product requires a colorist.
              Creating comics can be a very collaborative process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Underground and independent comics did not always follow this
              approach. They might produce comics alone or as a duo of
              creators to come up with story and art collaboratively.
            </p>

            <p class="text-center">

            <p>
              Most importantly, what was depicted on the page was not limited
              by budget or available locations and actors, as is the case in
              filmmaking. Given sufficient time and talent, anything could be
              drawn on the page, be it a vast space fleet, a rock concert with
              thousands of people in the audience, a robot army, an alien
              world, or a caricatured celebrity. Comics could be "artsy" or
              actually artistic. They could depict high adventure or devious
              drama; they could be juvenile or raunchy. And, of course, they
              could show the high jinks and tribulations of superheroes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any story or genre could find its place on a comic's page, only
              limited by the creators' imaginations. Given the right
              technological advancements, comics not only were capable of
              subverting genres but potentially, they might even subvert art
              itself.

              Nowadays, computers are prolific. Pretty much everyone has one
              in their pockets in the shape of a smartphone. Some people even
              wear computers. Digital technology is everywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we turn the dial back to 1984, we see that computers were
              still thought of as a science-fiction device. While kids loved
              their video games, adults regarded computers with awe. At the
              time, few understood what they were capable of then or how
              transformative they would be in all areas of life going forward.
              Only two years prior, William Gibson had coined the term
              "cyberspace." The writer had published his debut novel
              <em>Neuromancer,</em> a book that led a wave of excitement about
              the possibilities of computers. In 1984 Apple founder Steve Jobs
              introduced the first Macintosh computer.

              Colliding at the Cross-Section of Art and Technology
            </h3>
            <p>
              It seemed that the Apple Macintosh was destined for graphics
              work, for art. At its launch, Apple made programs available such
              as MacPaint and MacDraw. This opened up a world of possibilities
              for artists and for computer-assisted art and design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the history of comics, writers and artists have
              experimented with the medium in a multitude of ways. They have
              developed artistic techniques to change existing conventions
              into something new. Through changes in the culture around them,
              they have seen new perspectives and depicted the cognitive shift
              in their work. In the early 1980s, comics grew stale and timid.
              The mainstream titles such as <em>The Uncanny X-Men</em> and
              <em>The New Teen Titans</em> had turned from the daring upstarts
              to the status quo. Not only audiences but also the artists
              producing comic books had a constant hunger for something fresh
              and exciting.

              The advent of the first affordable graphics computer, the
              zeitgeist of cyberpunk, and the hunger for new visuals and
              storytelling collided at the cross section of technology and
              art. In 1985 they converged to create <em>Shatter</em>, the
              first digitally produced comic book.

            <h3 class="mt-5">What Is <em>Shatter</em> About?</h3>
            <p>
              First Comics Publishing's <em>Shatter</em> was created by artist
              Mike Saenz and writer Peter B. Gillis. It is a self-described
              tech-noir thriller, the story of the private eye Sadr al-Din
              Morales, commonly referred to as <em>Shatter</em>. The story is
              very much of its time. Much of it stands on the shoulders of
              works such as Ridley Scott's 1982 film <em>Bladerunner</em> and
              Gibson's novel <em>Neuromancer.</em> In its own campy way,
              <em>Shatter</em> discusses concepts that are nowadays common and
              perhaps even quaint, such as the dangers of technology in a
              dystopian future and the distrust of corporations. In its own
              way, the book eschews the main subject matter of mainstream
              comic books by aspiring to be cyberpunk without explicitly
              claiming to be it. Cyberpunk, we remember, is the grim and
              gritty science fiction sub-genre. This "combination of lowlife
              and high tech" (as described by Bruce Sterling in his preface to
              William Gibson's <em>Burning Chrome</em>) features advanced
              technology, such as global networks, brain-computer interfaces,
              and artificial intelligence, all coexisting and competing with
              the radical breakdown of social order, as only the early 1980s
              could imagine.
            </p>

            <p>
              The protagonist, <em>Shatter</em>, takes on the job of tracking
              down a serial killer who killed the board members of a large
              corporation. When he finds her, she reveals to him that the
              corporation uses human RNA to transfer the skill sets of people
              to others. Our hero finds himself involved with the underground
              movement dedicated to stopping this practice. In a surprising
              turn of events, <em>Shatter</em> finds out that he has "golden
              brain" that keeps any RNA-induced talents indefinitely without
              losing them, as everyone else does eventually.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Shatter</em> occasionally veers toward the prophetic when it
              depicts our protagonist bidding on a "gig" to take a case,
              hinting at today's emerging "gig economy," as found on
              fiverr.com and upwork.com. Other concepts sound unrealistic but
              not completely out of the question, such as splicing talents
              into a person's RNA to give them the special abilities of a
              gifted artist, athlete, or businessman.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the story is not what makes <em>Shatter</em> special. It is
              the process of its creation.

            <h3 class="mt-5">Digital Storytelling</h3>
            <p>
              Finding a true "first" is never cut and dry, so calling
              <em>Shatter</em> the first digitally produced comic might not be
              completely true. If we dig deeply into the Bulletin Board System
              (BBS) culture of the late 70s to early 80s, the precursor to the
              web and the internet as we know it today, we will find users who
              had distributed digitally produced comics as ASCII art,
              semigraphics, or even as digitized captures of analog art. That
              being said, <em>Shatter</em> deserves one commendation for being
              "first": It definitely was the first commercially available
              digitally produced comic book.

            <p>
              In 1985 <em>Shatter</em> showed that the potential for
              computer-assisted comic-book art was a reality. The art for
              publication was drawn by hand on the computer as opposed to
              later methods of scanning in inked pages for digital coloring.
              Publisher First Comics Publishing had a potential hit on their
              hands—a hit through the novelty of new technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Artist Mike Saenz started with a series of rough pencil sketches
              for each page. These were reviewed by the editors of the comic.
              When approved, Saenz drew the comic pages on a Macintosh Plus
              with 1MB RAM using MacPaint and MacDraw. The pages were saved on
              a disk drive with floppies holding a paltry 800 KB. The greatest
              challenge was drawing on the nine-inch monochrome screen with a
              resolution of 512 x 342 pixels. The screen was so small that the
              artist could only see and work on a section of the current page
              (by some accounts, two-thirds of the page<sup><a id="shatter-chapter-2-footnote-origin-6"
                  href="#shatter-chapter-2-footnote-6">[6]</a></sup>). Saenz drew the pages using the standard Mac
              mouse; there
              were no scanners available to capture analog art, and the
              artists of <em>Shatter</em> only procured digitizer tablets at a
              later time.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the first issues, the artist printed the pages on an Apple
              dot-matrix ImageWriter. In late 1985, when the regular series
              launched, Apple donated a LaserWriter.

              Quoting series editor Mike Gold in the editorial of
              <em>Shatter</em> #1:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
              Better still, Apple came out with their LaserWriter, an
              unbelievable printer that produces crisp, sharp printouts of
              Mike's work. For graphics art reproduction, the difference
              between the LaserWriter and traditional dot-matrix printers is
              like the difference between glossy coffee-table art books and
              paintings on cave walls. And better still, the folks up at Apple
              <strong>gave</strong> us a LaserWriter. That sucker isn't
              exactly cheap; it's nice to know you're appreciated. Thanks,
              Apple!
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The LaserWriter enabled Adobe PostScript font styles for
              typesetting text and made illustration graphics smoother and
              less pixelated because of the device's powerful interpolation.

            <p>
              The three people most closely identified with
              <em>Shatter</em> are artist Mike Saenz, writer Peter B. Gillis
              (both of whom created the series), and artist Charlie Athanas,
              who joined the publication in issue #8.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chicago-born artist Mike Saenz started work on
              <em>Shatter</em> at the age of 26. The book was among his first
              professional work and served as his breakthrough. After working
              on <em>Shatter</em>, Saenz went on to produce digital comics for
              Marvel and to work in software development.<sup><a id="shatter-chapter-2-footnote-origin-8"

              Peter B. Gillis was an established comics writer when he started
              work on <em>Shatter</em> at the age of 32. He had freelanced for
              Marvel Comics with his first published story in
              <em>Captain America.</em> After numerous credits in Marvel's
              second-tier comic books, Gillis went on to work as an editor for
              the Florida-based publisher New Media Publishing until 1981. His
              first work for First Comics Publishing was the science-fiction
              series <em>Warp</em> until 1985. Then he joined the team of
              <em>Shatter</em><sup><a id="shatter-chapter-2-footnote-origin-9"

              In the early 1980s, publisher First Comics Publishing was one of
              the few alternatives to the "big two": Marvel Comics (<em>Spider-Man,</em>
              <em>X-Men,</em> <em>Avengers</em>) and DC Comics (<em>Superman,</em>
              <em>Batman,</em> <em>Wonder Woman</em>).
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Shatter</em> saw its first printing in the British computer
              games magazine <em>Big K,</em> issue #12, its last issue before
              it ceased publication. It was a four-page story printed in black
              and white.<sup><a id="shatter-chapter-2-footnote-origin-10"
                  href="#shatter-chapter-2-footnote-10">[10]</a></sup>
              The series was touted as "the first computerized comic."
              According to one report, Saenz and Gillis had offered the series
              to Marvel Comics, who declined; only then was it picked up by
              First Comics Publishing.<sup><a id="shatter-chapter-2-footnote-origin-11"
                  href="#shatter-chapter-2-footnote-11">[11]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              After its debut, <em>Shatter</em> went on to be published by
              First Comics Publishing (Chicago) as a back-up feature to the
              ongoing comic series <em>Jon Sable.</em> These eight-page
              installments ran from issues #25 to #30 of the
              <em>Jon Sable</em> series. The feature proved to be so popular
              that publisher First Comics decided to release a
              <em>Shatter</em> special issue with 28 original story pages by
              Mike Saenz and Peter B. Gillis.

            <p>
              It sold 100,000 copies in three days, breaking the existing
              sales records for independent comic books. In 1985 a
              high-selling issue of Marvel Comics's
              <em>The Uncanny X-Men</em> sold 300,000 copies. By comparison,
              sales of <em>Shatter</em> were very impressive for an
              independent comics publisher.
            </p>
            <p>
              First Comics commissioned an ongoing series. At this point,
              writer Peter B. Gillis had moved on, so the artist Mike Saenz
              started to not only draw the book but also provide the plot and
              script.
            </p>

              The first issue of the ongoing <em>Shatter</em> series sold
              60,000 copies. After releasing issue #2, Mike Saenz left his

              produce the full-color digital graphic novel
              <em>Iron Man: Crash</em> for Marvel Comics and work on the comic
              creation app ComicWorks before being bought out by software
              maker Macromedia.

            <p>
              This paper was written in 2018. Now, more than 30 years later,
              it is difficult to assess what the original audience reaction
              was at the time of publication. The few remaining reviews show
              very positive feedback lauding the use of the Macintosh. In
              hindsight, much of the praise is directed towards the promised
              potential of digital art and not always the results on display
              at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the series' letters pages, readers criticized the story for
              being a derivative of <em>Blade Runner.</em> In issue #2, one
              reader writes:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
              "The only thing bad about it is the story. It does not make much
              sense and the whole thing is terrible."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              While the digital art did find a lot of praise ("The graphics
              inside are excellent" from the letters column in issue #2), it
              was not universally praised, as can be seen in this letter from
              the same issue:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
              "The graphics in <em>Shatter</em> are likely to be more of a
              turn off to potential computer comic connoisseurs due to their
              primitive quality and unimaginative execution."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The oddest reactions still available in their original form are
              from the letters pages of the series. First Comics Publishing
              advertised the digital nature of the series and went to great
              lengths to explain the process in its editorial pages.
              Nevertheless, in issue #3, a reader writes that they doubt that
              the art was, in fact, produced on a computer:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
              I'm not accusing you of doing anything yet, but a lot of
              <em>Shatter</em> #1 looked like it wasn't quite done by computer
              ... The curves in the walls are just too perfect, even for a
              computer ... I figure if you're going to do a comic on a
              computer, you ought to make it look like a computer drawing, not
              like a drawing done by hand.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The editor responded that for a small fee they would be happy to
              send a disk to the reader with the original artwork in its
              digital form as proof.

              After moving on to DC Comics, Mike Gold, the original editor of
              <em>Shatter</em>, reminisced about the series in the
              introduction of DC's own digital comic effort
              <em>Batman: Digital Justice</em> in 1990 (emphasis provided by
              the writer of this paper):
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
              At that time, I was the editor of a midwest comic book company
              when a couple of old friends, Peter Gillis and Mike Saenz,
              showed me rough printouts of a story that was produced on a 128
              K Apple Macintosh computer, using but one disk drive. The
              artwork was chunky and brittle: it looked like
              <em>some amphetamine addict had been given a box of a zip-a-tone
                that suffered from a glandular disease.</em>
              But the look was totally unique to comics. Within several
              months, we refined the look and the resulting effort
              <em>Shatter</em> was one of the best-selling comics of the year.
              It completely astonished the folks over at Apple Computer, Inc.,
              who never perceived such a use for their hardware.

            <h3 class="mt-5">Tumultuous Changes</h3>
            <p>
              Ultimately, <em>Shatter</em> would run for 14 issues from 1985
              to 1988, but in 1986, after Mike Saenz left, First Comics
              Publishing did not want its successful series to suffer delay.
              Not to leave the series without a writer and an artist, Steven
              Grant jumped in to fill the writer's role for issues #3 and #4
              while Steve Erwin and Bob Dienenthal took over the art chores
              for issues #3 to #7.

            <p>
              The art in these issues was workable but no longer special
              because the artists penciled and inked traditionally and had
              their pages scanned into the Macintosh to be lettered in
              MacPaint. This deprived <em>Shatter</em> of its special look.
              The art degraded to standard comic book art, albeit strongly
              pixelated to suggest that computers remained a vital part of the
              production process.
            </p>
            <p>
              At least in issue #5, original writer Peter B. Gillis returned
              to the fold to give the story focus and the dialog edge. But
              <em>Shatter</em> would still need another couple of issues
              before it could hit its stride with a new artist coming on
              board.

            <p>
              The departure of Mike Saenz left <em>Shatter</em> without its
              main selling point: art drawn directly on a computer. The book
              needed to return to its unique art style. It needed a new artist
              who was capable of producing the artwork on a Macintosh. Enter
              Charlie Athanas<sup><a id="shatter-chapter-2-footnote-origin-12"
                  href="#shatter-chapter-1-footnote-12">[12]</a></sup>. This young artist from Illinois joined the team
              just in time
              to continue the storyline Peter B. Gillis started.
            </p>
            <p>On his website, Athanas describes the process:</p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
              Artwork created from layout to the black and white 'camera
              ready' art before color was added in the traditional method. I
              produced this art on a MacPlus with 1 MB of RAM and an 800 K
              floppy drive. Only about two-thirds of a full page was visible
              to work on unless you switched to thumbnail mode to see the
              entire page on a drastically reduced scale. About half the
              issues were drawn with the standard Mac mouse until a small
              drawing tablet became commercially available.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Athanas re-established drawing directly on the Macintosh Plus
              with the computer mouse. To speed up publication efficiency,
              Athanas drafted rough pencil sketches in order to sketch out
              layout design, speed up the writing of the script, and go
              through editorial review.

              Without scanners at his disposal, Athanas manually redrew the
              rough sketches directly on this Mac. Now that the series was
              back to computer-drawn artwork, the pages had a much cleaner art
              style. Athanas not only used MacPaint but also FullPaint by Ann
              Arbor Softworks.

              <em>Shatter</em> was saved for the time being. Sales stabilized
              with the new creative team. But alas, technology progressed at a
              breakneck pace in the mid to late 80s. The home-computer
              revolution had started to sweep computers into every American
              household. A comic series about a dystopian future no longer
              captured its readers' imaginations. With issue #12, Peter B.
              Gillis left as a writer to be succeeded by Jay Case. First
              Comics Publishing met with financial difficulties, and the
              series' novelty of new technology wore off. Sales started to
              slip, and by 1988 they had dropped sufficiently to make the
              publication no longer viable. First Comics Publishing allowed
              the creators to complete their story but no longer start a new
              one. <em>Shatter</em> was cancelled with issue #14.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus ended the first sustained experiment in commercial
              digital-art production after three tumultuous years. By then,
              editor Mike Gold had left for DC Comics, leaving editor Rick
              Oliver to write the last words for the series in the letters
              page of <em>Shatter</em> #14 (cover date April 1988):
            </p>

            <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
              When <em>Shatter</em> first appeared, it was produced solely
              with the software that came packaged with the Macintosh; Apple's
              own MacPaint. More recently, we have also incorporated MacDraw,
              Word, Switcher, MacBillboard, and FullPaint. This letters column
              and the First Notes page were produced with Word and XPress, an
              electronic page make-up program.

              There are more new graphics programs available every day, each
              more sophisticated than the last, and there's no telling where
              it will all lead.
            </p>
            <p>
              But for now, <em>Shatter</em> has served its purpose, and it's
              time to move on. Thanks to all our loyal readers who stuck it
              out through both the great and the not-so-great issues. Thanks
              to Peter Gillis and Mike Saenz for starting the ball rolling,
              Steve Erwin and Bob Dienethal for keeping it going and finally,
              let's give a big hand for Charlie Athanas for revitalizing the
              book for a classy finish.
            </p>
            <p>
              The technology might not yet have been advanced enough, but
              <em>Shatter</em> proved one thing to the comic book industry:
              comics could be produced digitally, and dots by any other name
              could still be art.

              For the purposes of this paper, it is of great interest to
              compare the process used to create <em>Shatter</em> with the
              process used most commonly in American comics of the 1980s and
              then juxtapose that with the process used nowadays (2018). This
              will show how much <em>Shatter</em> deviated from its
              contemporaries and allow us to investigate how much of its
              production process can be found in today's comic books.

              The writer of the comic typed the story and the script on his
              typewriter and sent it to the editor for review.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once approved, this physical script went to the penciller, who
              sketched the rough layout scribbles of the 22 individual pages.
              These were much smaller than the original artwork or the printed
              page and served for design purposes. Then the penciller drew the
              actual pages (usually at double the size of the printed page)
              with the figures, the props, and the background scenery or
              locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some cases, the penciled pages were returned to the writer
              who then provided the script for the captions, dialog, and
              thought balloons. In other cases, the script already had all the
              captions and dialog when the penciller received it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the next stage, the letterer drew the caption boxes, speech
              bubbles, and thought balloons to then place the letters in them.
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as the penciled and lettered pages were completed, they
              were sent to the inker. They redrew the penciller's art by
              tracing the lines—providing them with weight, cleaning them up,
              and giving the solids some texture. The inker made sure that
              objects in the distance were drawn with a faint line and closer
              objects or characters were drawn with the full weight they
              needed to tell the story.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, the colorist applied colors and tones to the artwork by
              hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pages of the comic book are then photographed for print and
              reduced to the desired size<sup><a id="shatter-chapter-3-footnote-origin-13"

            <p>
              The digital workflow of <em>Shatter</em> also starts with the
              script. But as described by Mike Gold, the series' editor, in
              the editorial of <em>Shatter</em> Special #1, "... Peter would
              dialogue Mike's art on an Apple III, but it would be lettered on
              the Mac."
            </p>
            <p>
              In <em>Shatter</em> #3, Editor Mike Gold continued to describe
              the process: "Virtually everything in <em>Shatter</em>, prior to
              the coloring phase, is generated as Apple Macintosh MacPaint
              computer files and then printed on an Apple Laserwriter."
            </p>

            <p>
              And further in the editorial of <em>Shatter</em> Special #1:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
              Together with First Comics' production manager Alex Said and
              editorial coordinator Rick Oliver, we agreed that every aspect
              of <em>Shatter</em> would be performed on the Mac - the art, the
              lettering, the logo, the advertising, even this editorial.
              Everything but the color. We could create the color on the Mac
              (and we could come up with some interesting effects by creating
              a wider range of tones) but it would take far too much time.
            </blockquote>

              So, the process used for <em>Shatter</em> saved on transcribing
              the script and on producing the pencils to be inked because the
              artwork was drafted directly on the computer. The coloring as
              the last step still maintained the established traditional
              workflow and did not save any time in this respect.

            <h3 class="mt-5">The Typical Process in 2018</h3>
            <p>
              Today, we need to distinguish between comic books produced by
              the "big two" commercial comic book publishers, Marvel and DC
              Comics (and to a lesser extent, the next large publishers Image
              and Dark Horse), and those comics produced by independent
              artists or groups of artists.
            </p>

            <h4>Commercial Comics</h4>
            <p>
              Even at the time of writing this paper, the steps in creating a
              physically printed commercial comic book have not changed
              drastically compared to 1985, but the process is greatly
              expedited. A writer writes the plot and the script and sends it
              as an email to the editor who then provides all the changes and
              forwards it to the artist.
            </p>
            <p>
              This where the process becomes very disparate. Different artists
              work differently. Some will still draw the artwork on paper
              board using a pencil and then either ink it themselves or pass
              it on to an inker to be embellished. Even if this analog path is
              chosen, some artists will still use digital references or even
              trace from printouts of digital sources. They might model
              difficult background shots using 3D software and then draw from
              this reference. In any case, the artwork is scanned into the
              computer and sent as a digital file to the publisher for further
              processing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two steps in the process have switched nearly exclusively to
              digital: lettering and sound effects and the coloring of the
              book.
            </p>

            <p class="text-center">
              <img src="img/picture26.jpg" alt="Figure 24" class="img-fluid" />
            </p>
            <p class="text-secondary text-center">
              Figure 24: An artist using a Wacom Cintiq 24"<br />(Source:

            </p>

            <p>
              While a large part of the drawings for commercial comic books is
              still produced using analog means, the tendency to produce
              purely digitally is slowly prevailing in independent comics.
              Artists either draft their artwork directly on a screen using a
              Wacom tablet, Microsoft Surface, or iPad Pro or they sketch on
              paper and refine their work digitally. Some artists use 3D
              software to meticulously render their characters, props, and
              backgrounds. Then they combine the components using paint or
              layout software.
            </p>
            <p>
              That being said, commercial superstar artists like DC Vice
              President and one of the current <em>Superman</em> artists Jim
              Lee and <em>Green Lantern</em> artist Ethan Van Sciver still
              pencil and ink their work<sup><a id="shatter-chapter-3-footnote-origin-14"
                  href="#shatter-chapter-3-footnote-14">[14]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though exceptions do exist, to this day, the mainstream
              process is still not fully digital with analog steps remaining
              for drafting and inking. The process of coloring and lettering
              are fully digital. One of the reasons for the pedantically
              segmented process in commercial comics is strict editorial
              control over every step. This not only allows the editor to play
              gatekeeper, catching any potential quality issues or any part of
              the commissioned work that might be inadequate or inappropriate,
              it also allows the editor to keep an eye on the progress of the
              comic book from the first word laid down to the finished piece
              being delivered to the printer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Strangely, this only partially digital production process needs
              to end in a digital file for printers to handle. Even though the
              sales of physical comic books are dwindling in 2018, digital
              distribution of comic books through vendors like comixology.com
              cannot yet compensate for the drop in sales.
            </p>

            <h4>Independent Artists</h4>
            <p>
              Again, it is hard to generalize; there will always be artists
              who prefer traditional analog means. In some cases, they might
              not even use pencil and ink on paper but could use a completely
              different analog media, such as oil on canvas or collage or any
              of the multitude of different techniques established over the
              centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Independent comics artists often work alone or, at most, in a
              small team. They mostly do not have a support infrastructure, so
              they do more on their own. This is one of the reasons why
              digital production is more common in the field of independent
              artists.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to the lack of editorial control, the process does not even
              always need to start with a ready plot and script but can start
              with sketches that evolve into a complete story. But for the
              sake of comparability, let us start the digital process an
              independent artist uses with the story creation (plot and
              potentially script). They then might produce thumbnail layouts
              of the pages to get an idea of the story flow and the necessary
              number of panels. This might be done on paper or, already at
              this stage, on the computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then the digital artist completes the final stages with digital
              tools. Outline art might be drawn similarly to previous
              techniques with a sketch, a finer rendering of the sketch in
              more detail, and then the final cleanup. But because they are
              working digitally, they are not bound to the processes of
              physical media.
            </p>
            <p>
              After rendering the outlines, the color art can be produced
              without delay or the need to change medium in the next step.
              Lettering and sound effects are added. And the page is done.
            </p>
            <p>
              Purely digital pieces can be distributed over the web; those
              produced for print can be emailed to the printers for direct
              printing.

            <p>
              In contrast, <em>Shatter</em> was limited by the available means
              of communication, with disks with the digital materials being
              mailed conventionally. But save for this, the whole process was
              digital. The limitations of the printing presses made it
              necessary to produce a hardcopy of the line art so that it could
              be photographed for the plate-based offset printing of the day.
              Coloring solely on a computer was not yet feasible on the
              machines available in 1985, remaining a task to be done by hand
              the traditional way.

              While Mike Saenz was the first to produce and publish a complete
              comic book on a computer, other artists quickly followed. In
              1988, German comic book artist Michael Götze created the
              <em>Das Robot Imperium</em> comic album. This was the first
              European comic created on a computer. He did not use an Apple
              Macintosh to create this black-and-white comic, but instead the
              Atari 520ST, an affordable competitor of the Mac that also came
              with a mouse by default.

              The comic's story chronicled the fight of a small group of
              humans against the robots who ruled over them. Even in the
              1980s, this was not the most original plot. Like
              <em>Shatter</em>, this comic's main selling point was that the
              artist created it on a computer.

              more lavish and elaborate work compared to <em>Shatter</em>. The
              scenes depicted in the panels have depth and dimensionality. The
              figures are not flat like in <em>Shatter</em>, Goetze renders
              the characters' faces with much greater expressiveness. He took
              much more time to produce each page than the fast release

            <p>
              On the Atari ST, Götze programmed his own 3D wireframe
              application and special printing software using
              <em>GFA-Basic.</em> In the application he called
              <em>Pixelart,</em> Götze created 3D models of the human body and
              put them in different poses. Then he combined the figures with
              flat backgrounds. He also modeled props and mechanical
              backgrounds like a command center in 3D. Once the 3D models were
              created, he could place them in the scene and create complicated
              perspectives with the wireframe models. Eventually, Goetze had a
              library of objects that he could reuse.
            </p>
            <p>
              He would laboriously touch up the images in the Atari ST paint
              application <em>D.E.G.A.S. Elite</em> using the mouse to give
              them the final polish.
            </p>
            <p>
              Work on <em>Robot Imperium</em> started in 1986 on the first of
              three volumes in the European album format. Götze drew the first
              volume in black-and-white. The gradients were dot patterns
              printed with a typical dot-matrix printer used in offices at the
              time: the Epson FX-80.
            </p>
            <p>
              The back of the first two volumes shows a photo of the artist
              Götze toiling away on his Atari ST. And the last few pages of
              the first volume describe Götze's process for drawing the panels
              on the Atari ST: "This Is How a Comic Is Made on a Computer"
              ("So entsteht ein Comic am Computer"). From today's perspective,
              it might appear comedic that the process description includes a
              short explanation of how a computer mouse works. There even is
              mention of <em>Shatter</em> by Mike Saenz and Peter B. Gillis
              (inexplicably, Gillis is referred to as Bernd Gillis in the
              text). The piece's writer does not show high regard for Saenz'
              computer art, calling it "unsatisfactory" and "experimental."
            </p>
            <p>
              The most interesting parts of this description were the
              screenshots of the individual steps in Götze's creation process.
              They show how he places the rudimentary 3D model of a spaceship
              over a rough sketch of the background foliage in a forest scene.
              The wireframes of the spaceship show all sides, even the parts
              that should be obscured from the viewer. Götze manually cleans
              up the image, meticulously removing the lines that should not be
              visible. Then he embellishes the manually-drawn backgrounds,
              thus integrating them with the 3D model. Then he spots the black
              areas and emphasizes individual lines to give them more weight.
              Finally, he shades the image in dotted patterns for different
              levels of light and dark.
            </p>
            <p>
              Artistically, this painstaking process proved to be very
              successful. The drawings are very much in the style of the
              French bandes desinée of the 1980s. This speaks to the artist's
              craftsmanship. Götze followed the first volume with the second
              one titled "Volthead" in 1990, this time in full color. It was
              printed on a dot-matrix printer in multiple passes with
              different colored ribbons.

              In 1992, Götze released the third volume "Ein erster Sieg?" ("A
              First Victory?") with an even greater level of detail in his
              drawings and an even greater level of artistic accomplishment.
              Its slickness moved it so close to the traditionally drawn and
              colored analog comics to make it indistinguishable at first
              glance. This also meant that despite all the effort put into it,
              the comic lost one of its most distinguishing features. It lost
              the "look" of a computer comic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Commercially, Das Robot Imperium ended up not being very
              successful. It remains a testimony to artistic dedication,
              adventurous graphical experimentation, and the stubbornness to
              make the best use of the capabilities of a barely suitable
              computer to achieve professional results.

              The Importance of <em>Shatter</em> as Media Art
            </h3>
            <p>
              <em>Shatter</em> is very much of its time. The
              computer-generated art from the mid-80s is stiff and
              un-lifelike. At the same time, it shows a mad energy that comes
              from artists discovering what a piece of equipment can do beyond
              what anyone thought before them. This energy might be fueled by
              the intention to subvert the traditional comics production
              process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The art style is primitive by nowadays standards, but it is most
              definitely the star of the series compared to the
              run-of-the-mill story content. It is still visually interesting
              to look at each page and wonder at the intricacies that Mike
              Saenz and Charlie Athanas were able to eke out of their
              Macintosh.
            </p>
            <p>
              While only modestly entertaining as a piece of commercial
              entertainment, <em>Shatter</em> is a cultural artifact and a
              relic of a long-bygone era, with a good helping of quirkiness
              and originality in execution. It shows the evolutionary step
              taken to where technology has brought us today. To stay in
              evolutionary terms, this comic book is the fish whose fins more
              resemble legs, even though it has not yet fully left the sea. In
              essence, the idea of <em>Shatter</em> is fascinating. The idea
              that one day, comics might be produced digitally, but in 1985
              Mike Saenz and Peter B. Gillis (and later Charlie Athanas) were
              impatient and did not want to wait for technology to catch up
              with their aspirations.

              Archiving <em>Shatter</em> for Media Arts Histories
            </h3>
            <p>
              Even though <em>Shatter</em> was produced digitally, it was
              always targeted at being printed. Its creators and the
              publishing company sought to print it and distribute it as a
              physical product. Preservation of individual printed copies is
              subject to the same principles as preserving other kinds of
              print media and periodicals: temperature- and moisture-regulated
              archives and a complete absence of light during storage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from the physical medium, <em>Shatter</em> is one of the
              earliest artifacts with the raw content available as digital
              files. Unfortunately, the demise of First Comics Publishing has
              made it unlikely for us to use this venue to obtain the original
              digital files in the MacPaint format. It is certainly possible
              to seek out the files from the original artists. The physical
              media the files are stored on (disks or hard disks) might
              already be corrupted after three decades of storage. If the
              files can be found, then they can be archived in distributed
              storage systems such as a cloud or a raid setup. In one of the
              letters columns, the editor notes that for a small handling fee,
              the publishing company would be prepared to send a disk with
              digital artwork to interested parties. If any readers made use
              of this, then digital copies might be stored away on disks
              somewhere in the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from the files generated during production, there might
              even be an animated digital trailer. According to one source,
              the original artist even put together something of the kind that
              was distributed on a disk<sup><a id="shatter-chapter-5-footnote-origin-15"
                  href="#shatter-chapter-5-footnote-15">[15]</a></sup>. These might also still be available.
            </p>
            <p>It exceeds the mandate of this paper to locate them.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-5">Learning from <em>Shatter</em></h3>
            <p>
              One might argue that it is not a matter of whether
              <em>Shatter</em> is a good piece of entertainment, an
              accomplished piece of art, or the culmination of a cultural
              discipline. Even at the time of its creation, it never pretended
              or aspired to be any of this. To many, <em>Shatter</em> exudes
              the strange fascination that Eadweard Muybridge's sequential
              photography of galloping horses and walking men and women in
              Victorian times manifests, even though we have contemporary 4K
              footage of the same motifs in much higher quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              It can even be argued that <em>Shatter</em> is not an artifact
              from the past that has had a great influence on how we create
              and even read comics today. Its reach was not great enough to
              have done so. But the technology it employed at the time
              certainly had taken its first steps towards the total
              digitization of the visual arts. Today we have become used to
              seeing computer-generated graphics in film, in commercial art,
              and in comics. The creators of <em>Shatter</em> were the first
              to see these possibilities in the available hardware before it
              was capable enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we run original Macintosh software in emulation, software
              such as MacPaint, MacDraw, and FullPaint, it is easy to lose
              sight of the context it was used in at the time. Perhaps,
              <em>Shatter</em> can open our eyes to this context. We shouldn't
              frown upon software's limitations but recognize how artists in
              the past used it for actual honest-to-God production work. They
              did not see the restrictions, rather they saw the potential for
              experimentation. And all of this with the pressure of
              publication deadlines looming.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exploring <em>Shatter</em> not only shows us the achievements of
              the creators but also their omissions, failings, and blind
              spots: They did not make any use of the nascent 3D graphics
              already taking shape on the 16-Bit machines of the time. In the
              year of <em>Shatter</em>'s cancellation, comics artist Michael
              Goetze, from Germany, had already been making use of 3D graphics
              in his electronic comic <em>Das Robot Imperium</em> (Carlsen
              Comics, 1988) on the Atari ST, a 16-Bit computer of a similar
              generation as the Apple Macintosh.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is easy to take <em>Shatter</em> at face value and only see
              its clunkiness, its deficiencies, and the ineptitude in its
              execution. As an audience and perhaps even as fellow artists, we
              can all instead look at <em>Shatter</em> and ask ourselves how
              much time and effort Mike Saenz and Charlie Athanas have put
              into the work. At any point in their creative process, they had
              the opportunity to give up and abandon this tedious and
              thankless exercise. Perhaps, at some point, each one of them
              stepped back from the nine-inch screen, with its monochrome line
              art, and shook their heads, thinking how much effort they had
              put into this work that to some audiences might look bad or
              even, as Mike Gold put it, like "some amphetamine addict had
              been given a box of a zip-a-tone." Maybe they thought how much
              easier it might have been to take pencil and pen to paper
              instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              And perhaps they knew how "cool" they were, and perhaps they
              felt how subversive their art was because they were at the
              technological razor's edge in a world not yet ready for it.

                In the 1960s American comics changed. They were always regarded
                as shrill, cheap, and trashy, with dropping sales in the past
                decade. Yet at their core, they became subversive, in tune with
                the rising counterculture of the 1960s. This decade brought a
                cultural explosion: questioning traditional modes of authority,
                protests against the war in Vietnam, a vocal youth culture, new
                music, widespread social tensions, liberated sexuality, women's
                rights, experimentation with psychoactive drugs<sup

                Scott McCloud describes comics as "juxtaposed pictorial and
                other images in a deliberate sequence, intended to convey
                information and/or produce an aesthetic response in the viewer."

                As an art form, they were much more than that; they were an echo
                of the world around them. And in the 1960s they transformed
                along two different lines: commercial comics and the "comix
                underground."

              <p>
                By the 1960s "mainstream" comics were firmly set in the
                superhero genre. DC Comics, the industry's top dog, with its
                stable of superheroes such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman
                was being challenged by upstart Marvel comics. The work of
                writer Stan Lee and artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko subverted
                the comics mainstream that was traditionally oriented towards
                children. They introduced superheroes who appealed to older
                readers, breaking convention with other archetypes of the time
                by showing characters with personal flaws, who quarreled with
                their peers, and who lived in the eventful world of the 1960s.

                Randy Roberts and James S. Olson wrote that "Marvel Comics
                employed a realism in both characterization and setting in its

                In comics series such as <em>Fantastic Four</em>,
                <em>Doctor Strange</em>, and <em>Silver Surfer</em>, Kirby,
                Ditko, and Lee plotted grand "cosmic" ideas about
                extraterrestrial civilizations, different dimensions,
                personified embodiments of abstract notions, whole human
                cultures hidden from the world, and alien gods. Many of these
                concepts were exaggerated ideas previously encountered in
                science fiction, but the way the Marvel artists depicted it,
                much of the imagery was psychedelic and on a cosmic scale.

                The comics published at Marvel managed the then unique bridge
                between the absurdly grand and the humbly human. Simply put,
                Marvel comics were a breath of fresh air.

              <p>
                The second component of the one-two punch of the comics
                renaissance of the 1960s was underground comix (yes, spelled
                with an "x"). These small-press or self-published comic books
                often covered socially relevant issues in a satirical manner.
                Their art style flew in the face of the established superhero
                comics, ranging from deliberately dilettante to classically
                rendered or even caricature. Underground comix were not bound by
                the restrictions of other printed media, often openly depicting
                sexuality, explicit drug use, and violence.

                Underground comix subverted the limitations of the comics medium

              <p>
                To a certain extent, it is fair to say that drawing and
                distributing comics is not merely a function of art but very
                much of technology. It only became feasible to easily produce
                and distribute comic books once the process of printing became
                widely enough available and cheap enough to warrant it.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the reasons for the widespread adoption of comic books as
                a creative outlet was that creating a comic book took far fewer
                resources than other mediums. Making a movie back in the 1960s
                was an expensive and time-consuming endeavor, and getting a film
                distributed was often an insurmountable hurdle for fledgling
                filmmakers.
              </p>
              <p>
                To create a comic book, all you needed were pencil and paper,
                pen and ink . . . and something to say, a story to tell. Of
                course, if you wanted to touch the souls of your readers, you
                also needed talent. Even in the 1960s, finding and paying for a
                printer for the low print runs in black and white on cheap paper
                was feasible, if not always easy. To get something printed in
                color was far more expensive, and you would usually have to go
                to an established publisher.
              </p>
              <p>
                Underground artists could distribute their finished product
                themselves by using the many record stores or comics specialty
                shops in large metropolitan areas. Established publishers could
                default to newsstand distribution or mainstream retail outlets.

              <p>
                While printing technology and publishing have evolved over time,
                the core process of creating comics has not changed a lot. You
                tell a story in panels, usually rectangular sections that
                progress across the page with glimpses of what is happening with
                characters, objects, and locations drawn in them. Exposition and
                dialogue are lettered into boxes and speech bubbles. You even
                have a mechanism to show the thoughts of characters as clouds
                hovering close to their heads.
              </p>
              <p>
                Potentially, it only takes a single writer-artist to create a
                comic story. The creator thinks of a story plot and sketches it
                out roughly, either as thumbnail images or directly on the page
                where they will draw the artwork. Usually, the original artwork
                is in a format much larger than the printed result; the process
                of reducing it in print brings out the details.
              </p>
              <p>
                While a single individual <em>could</em> do everything
                themselves, and many have in the past, the process is most
                likely split up among more creators. A writer would write the
                plot and the dialog. A penciler sketches out the character,
                settings, and locations in the panels on a page, focusing on
                getting proportions and perspective right and telling the story
                the writer describes in their script. The inker takes the
                penciled pages and gives the pale lines weight, the depicted
                objects and characters texture, and even corrects the occasional
                lapse in the pencil. A letterer puts in the speech bubbles,
                captions, and thought balloons and adds sound effects where
                necessary. And finally, a color product requires a colorist.
                Creating comics can be a very collaborative process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Underground and independent comics did not always follow this
                approach. They might produce comics alone or as a duo of
                creators to come up with story and art collaboratively.
              </p>

              <p>
                Most importantly, what was depicted on the page was not limited
                by budget or available locations and actors, as is the case in
                filmmaking. Given sufficient time and talent, anything could be
                drawn on the page, be it a vast space fleet, a rock concert with
                thousands of people in the audience, a robot army, an alien
                world, or a caricatured celebrity. Comics could be "artsy" or
                actually artistic. They could depict high adventure or devious
                drama; they could be juvenile or raunchy. And, of course, they
                could show the high jinks and tribulations of superheroes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any story or genre could find its place on a comic's page, only
                limited by the creators' imaginations. Given the right
                technological advancements, comics not only were capable of
                subverting genres but potentially, they might even subvert art
                itself.
